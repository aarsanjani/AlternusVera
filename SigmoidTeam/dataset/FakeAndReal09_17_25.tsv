To Musk, putting someone who isn't an astronaut into space is a step toward spreading human life across the universe.

At the event, Musk described the current plans for SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, launch vehicle, which hasn't yet been completed and still requires funding. But when it is ready to fly around the moon, it will have Maezawa on board, he said.

Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has signed on to be the first private citizen to go into deep space, Elon Musk announced at a SpaceX event on Monday.

""There could be some natural event or man-made event that ends civilization as we know it and life as we know it,"" Musk said. ""It’s important that we try to become a multi-planet civilization, extend life beyond earth, and do so as quickly as we can.""

Maezawa, 47, is the founder of Start Today, a company behind a Japanese fashion retail website, as well as Zozo, which creates custom clothes for customers. He's also a major art collector, famously paying $110.5 million at auction for a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat last year. On Monday, he told the SpaceX crowd that he hopes to use his space flight to promote art.

""I choose to go to the moon with artists,"" said Maezawa, who declined to say how much he was paying SpaceX.

The trip is currently planned for 2023, and Maezawa said he will bring between six and eight artists with him as part of a project he's calling Dear Moon. The artists, who will represent disciplines from music to architecture, will then create a work based on their experience, Maezawa said.

""These masterpieces will inspire the dreamer in all of us,"" he said. ""If you should hear from me, please say yes and accept my invitation.""

Musk acknowledged that the plan may not come to fruition, even with the money already provided by Maezawa toward developing the rocket. The 2023 flight date is a best guess for when it could be ready, he said.

""There's so many uncertainties,"" Musk said. ""This is a ridiculously big rocket. It's got so much advanced technology. It's not 100% certain we succeed in getting this to flight. I think it's pretty likely, but it's not certain.""

Here's How She Responded	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	This Politician Was Called A Murderer For Getting A Late Term Abortion. Here's How She Responded	0	"Senator Janet Rice was brought to angry tears during a debate about abortion in parliament last night.

""And yet Senator Anning and Senator Stoker are willing to stand here in this place and call me a murderer."" @janet_rice speaking passionately on abortions yesterday in the Senate. https://t.co/1ph7S8J19p

The Greens politician terminated her second pregnancy at 21 weeks when she discovered her foetus had spina bifida and anencephaly, a condition that results in death soon after birth.

""Most ... late-term abortions are because there are issues with the development of the foetus, and that was certainly the case for mine, and yet Senator Anning and Senator Stoker are willing to stand here in this place and call me a murderer,"" Rice told the chamber during a debate on abortion.

Supplied A matter of public importance moved by Greens senator Rachel Siewert.

Liberal senator Amanda Stoker had just made a speech condemning proposed legislation to decriminalise abortion in Queensland as ""brutal"" and said that abortions in the second trimester were ""excruciating for the child"".

Senator Fraser Anning, who has moved multiple motions on abortion this year, said abortion was ""state-sanctioned murder"". Rice told the chamber: ""Anybody who wants to look at the facts about late-term abortions will see that a woman having a late-term abortion has gone through a huge thought process, discussion and consideration of whether it's the right thing to do.

""Hearing the contributions from the senators in this place, they are not listening to women. They have their very, very strong religious views that they are imposing on women.""

Rice told BuzzFeed News anti-abortion senators claimed to be worried about the psychological impact of abortion on women — ""and we know the psychological impact is far greater for women denied abortions"" — but they didn't care how their comments would impact the mental health of women who have had abortions. ""If they are concerned about the psychological impact on women, if they are truly listening to women, they would stop making such awful damaging attacks on women like we saw last night,"" she said. ""I know how much impact those words have and my emotion showed in the Senate."" Rice isn't the only politician recently who has found the debate upsetting because of her own experiences. Brisbane mother Melanie McKenzie last week brought a Labor MP to tears when she addressed the parliamentary committee currently looking into Queensland's legislation to decriminalise abortion.

McKenzie runs a not-for-profit organisation Harrison's Little Wings to support women and their families who have received a poor or fatal diagnosis in a pregnancy.

""These parents face perhaps the hardest decision of all when told of a fatal diagnosis of their unborn baby: whether or not to have a late termination,"" McKenzie told the committee. ""This is never a decision taken lightly or without much medical testing, diagnosis and medical advice."" In 2010 McKenzie's fourth son Harrison lived for just 28 hours due to an incurable condition, a diaphragmatic hernia, diagnosed at 20 weeks gestation. ""We chose to continue with our pregnancy,"" she said. ""Harrison was born full term weighing eight pounds 14 ounces."" ""I watched my son who was in obvious pain having to have invasive medical procedures."" McKenzie told the committee how helpless she felt not being able to hold or comfort her son.

arms as he died."" Labor MP Joan Pease became teary when thanking McKenzie for her testimony.

By Piper Blackmun

It’s obvious Trump voters are not quick on the uptake. However, some of them are finally figuring out that Trump, a millionaire trust-fund kid, doesn’t really care about them.

According to comments posted in the “Make America White Again” Facebook group, cracks seem to be forming in the walls of Trump support.

“I’m beginning to doubt if Trump really cares about working-class Southerners and other real Americans,” said LaVerne Short, a Trump supporter from Oxford, Miss. “I don’t think he’s ever driven a pick up truck or gone hunting. He doesn’t sound like one of us.”

Trump has been called “the blue-collar billionaire” because of his plain talk and love of fast food. But he has lived most of his life in cosmopolitan New York and inherited a fortune from his father. He has also cheated working people and expressed disdain for Southerners.

According to Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” he called Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is from Alabama, a “dumb redneck” and also suggested he was retarded. He also made fun of former wife Marla Maples’ relatives because of their Southern accents.

Politico reported: “If Sessions’ recusal was his original sin, Trump has come to resent him for other reasons, griping to aides and lawmakers that the attorney general doesn’t have the Ivy League pedigree the president prefers, that he can’t stand his Southern accent and that Sessions isn’t a capable defender of the president on television — in part because he ‘talks like he has marbles in his mouth,’ the president has told aides.”

According to the New York Times, new polls shows some working-class whites are beginning to sour on Trump.

“As noted, some of them are catching on. A Quinnipiac poll out this week showed that even among non-college-educated whites — the strongest demographic holdout for Trump — a plurality now say they’d like to see Congress be more of a check on the president. Since his election, he’s down 14 points among the ‘poorly educated’ that Trump once professed to love, a CNN poll found,” said Timothy Egan."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-rally-attendees.jpg

By Brian Wilkins

A white nationalist group has recognized FOX News commentator Tucker Carlson’s nightly rants against people of color.

The National White Alliance has announced that Carlson is a front runner for the Caucasian of the Year award. The award recognizes white people who have taken a strong stance to defend their race, said Alliance President Brian Blanc in a press release.

“Tucker is getting a lot of votes for the award. People are recognizing that he’s fighting for our race and want to reward him,” said Blanc.

Carlson, who has previously been employed at CNN and MSNBC, used to be your average right-wing mouthpiece, but in the last few years he has taken to spewing white nationalism. He tried to claim rap music, promoted the false narrative about white South African farmers being attacked, attacked immigrants and has also claimed that diversity is not improving the country. The only thing he hasn’t done at this stage is wear a hood and burn a cross on set.

Carlson’s racist ranting is attracting the attention of the alt-right blogosphere.

According to Columbia Journalism Review, “Other vocal fans of Carlson include Richard Spencer, David Duke, and white nationalist website The Daily Stormer. On August 24, 2018, The Daily Stormer published a post that noted gleefully, ‘Tucker Carlson is basically ‘Daily Stormer: The Show.’ Other than the language used, he is covering all of our talking points.”

The Daily Stormer is a white supremacist website.

However, the CJR article suggests that Carlson is a giant con. Although he portrays himself as the voice of downtrodden, blue-collar white men, Carlson comes from a wealthy family and is worth $8 million. But he realized there is a market for white rage.

“According to Nielsen Media Research, the top-rated markets for the show are Ft. Myers, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; West Palm Beach, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; Birmingham, Alabama; Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Buffalo, New York. Only half of these cities went for Trump in the 2016 election, but they are (with the exception of Birmingham and Atlanta) overwhelmingly white and middle class, with an average age of 36. A large part of the jobs held by men in each city are in retail or construction,” said CJR writer Lyz Lenz."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Fucker-Carlson.png

With Hurricane Florence currently buffeting South Carolina, America and the world is beginning to see the effects of climate change which causes extreme weather.

However, some right-wingers are determined to stick their heads in the sand and refuse to believe that climate change exists.

Televangelist Jim Bakker said the storm is punishment from God for violating his laws.

“I blame the transgenders for this. We didn’t see these kinds of storms when I was growing up,” said Bakker. “God is punishing us for allowing boys to wear dresses and women to pretend they are men.”

He isn’t the only Christian fundamentalist who believes this. According to Right Wing Watch, pastor Rick Joyner also blamed extreme weather on sin.

“More than dumping too much CO2 into the air or anything else, the scripture makes it clear what causes these things,” said Joyner. “It is sin. Sin, which is clearly defined in scripture. One of the worst things we could do to bring a curse on a nation is the shedding of innocent blood. What could be more innocent than the unborn? And look at what America is doing.”

President Donald Trump has dismissed global warming as being a “Chinese hoax.” And some Republicans seem to have a hard time getting their facts straight about Hurricane Florence. Talk show host and former junkie Rush Limbaugh claimed the storm had sucked up sharks, which is the exact plot of the movie “Sharknado.”

“This appeared somewhere. ‘Florence Now Contains Sharks.’ I’m telling you,” he said. “Sharks are being lifted out of the Atlantic Ocean and dumped into the storm because it’s so strong. It’s sucking ’em in there—and then they’re gonna be in the waters. Of course, the only water that might contain sharks would be storm surge—it isn’t gonna be raining sharks—and that’s the predominant water source in a hurricane is rainfall.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jim-bakker-e1514353755547.jpeg

Just when you think that President Donald Trump can’t get worse, he proves you wrong,

Recently he said that he didn’t believe the official death toll from Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico. The death toll has been recorded at about 3,000 people. However, Trump has declared his government’s relief mission was a resounding success and only about 18 people died.

Trump supporters also back the president. According to an Occidental Public Polling survey, 70 percent of Trump supporters believe the media inflated the death toll to make the president looked bad.

“The liberal media hates Trump and will do anything to make the president look bad,” said Don Callen, a Trump supporter from Tampa, Fla. “I reckon the media faked the numbers.”

And there are other Trump cultists who also believe this.

FOX News curmudgeon Lou Dobbs also backed the president.

“Only President Trump has had the guts to call out the Dems and national left wing media types, who have blindly accepted an amazing tortured inflation of the death toll, almost 50 times higher than the original count, and with scant evidence to support any of it,” said Dobbs. “How does that count go from dozens in the days after the storm to almost 3,000 nearly a year later? Well, it involves as many academicians as humanly possible in the effort, and then you watch the entire exercise become a farce.”

Also, Florida Gov. and Voldemort look-a-like Rick Scott felt the wrath of Trump cultists when he said the final death toll was more accurate. “I’ve been to Puerto Rico seven times and saw devastation firsthand,” said Scott in a tweet.

But he was attacked by Trump supporters.

“Stated like a politician running for a Senate seat. Trying to degrade @POTUS, who is under constant attack for EVERYTHING, doesn’t need someone he has helped tremendously trying to stick it to him. Not a good look on you,” said Carol Jordan Will."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/640px-Morning_after_Hurricane_Maria_37372721465.jpg

Former NFL star Colin Kaepernick simply won’t go away, much to the chagrin of Trump supporters. He has become the face of Nike and has boosted their sales by 31 percent. But Trump supporters are furious.

A Trump supporter in the Reddit group R_The Donald compared Kaepernick to Osama Bin Laden. “Kaepernick is just as bad as that turban topper, Bin Laden,” said Rusty43, “and we need to take care of him like Bin Laden. He needs to tried and executed for treason.”

Rusty43 wasn’t the only Trump supporters infuriated by Kaepernick and the NFL protest he sparked. Former NFL player Burgess Owens accused Kaepernick of assaulting America.

“We have to look at the bigger picture and understand in America that we’re under assault,” said Burgess in an appearance on FOX Business. “It’s like 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, we’re being assaulted by the left. And we need to understand who they are. They’re globalists, and they’re leftist globalists. The worst thing that can happen to our country is to let them get away with it and not understand what their long game is.”

Burgess also accused Kaepernick of being a “marxist.”

“As we see a little less of the kneeling, we’re still going to see the narrative by Nike,” said Owens, who is now a conservative commentator. “And that is a Marxist, who is going to be the face and commercial of the NFL going forward.”

Meanwhile, the protest against Kaepernick continues. Ben Zahn, mayor of Kenner, La. has banned Nike products from city facilities. “Under no circumstances will any Nike product or any product with the Nike logo be purchased for use or delivery at any city of Kenner Recreation Facility,” said Kenner in a memo.

He also added, “My decision is only to protect taxpayer dollars from being used in a political campaign. Some have asked if people will be allowed to wear Nike apparel on city playgrounds. The answer to that is … of course.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kaepernick-e1536793956757.jpg

It should clear by now that FOX News commentator Tucker Carlson is an open white nationalist.

In a guest appearance on neo-fascist network CRTV, Carlson claimed that whites should get credit for rap music.

“The blacks try to act like they created rap music. But white people deserve the credit, because it’s performed in English,” said Carlson. “Also, the first rap superstar was Vanilla Ice, a white person. But liberal Hollywood doesn’t want to talk about the contribution whites have made to rap music.”

Hip hop is an artform that grew out of New York, when black DJs, starting “rapping” over songs. It has been popularized by African Americans and spread across the world as the voice of underprivileged people. But don’t tell that to Carlson, who seems to think rap came out of coffee houses in the suburbs.

Carlson has been spouting white supremacist rhetoric on FOX News for quite a while. Recently he tried to claim that diversity was not an asset to the United States.

“How, precisely, is diversity our strength? Since you’ve made this our new national motto, please be specific as you explain it. Can you think, for example, of other institutions such as, I don’t know, marriage or military units in which the less people have in common, the more cohesive they are?” said Carlson in a rant. “Do you get along better with your neighbors, your co-workers if you can’t understand each other or share no common values? Please be honest as you answer this question.”

Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple called Carlson’s diversity rant “flat-out racist”

However Carlson also tried to claim tacos as an American food.

“What do you mean ‘their food’? It’s American food,” said Carlson. “It’s American! What do you think, you own tacos now or something?”

Progressive media watchdog Media Matters compiled a collection of Carlson’s quotes and noticed they sounded similar to racists such as Richard Spencer and David Duke."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tucker.jpg

While most sane-minded Americans were excited to see former President Barack Obama return to the public sphere, Republicans weren’t.

Most Americans were pleased to see the return of a president who spoke in complete sentences and talked about decency, but not members of the GOP. FOX News minstrel-of-the-month Candace Owens said Obama has returned to the public stage because he’s jealous of Trump’s success.

“Obama just couldn’t stand to see Trump succeed where he has failed, for example the most successful economy in history and the record black unemployment rate. He had to stick his nose in,” said Owens, in an appearance on CRTV. “Obama’s so arrogant, it has to be all about him.”

Other Republicans were equally incensed that Obama dared to criticize the trainwreck that is the Trump presidency.

The response from FOX News commentator and Trump zealot Jeanine Pirro was particularly unhinged.

“It has never happened in the history of this country, an ex-president viciously attacking his successor, trashing our commander-in-chief, his party, and all those Americans who put him in the Oval Office,” said Pirro. “Donald Trump is one of the biggest threats to our democracy? How dare you! This man is the president of the United States, someone we put in office, and he is to be respected!”

She also accused Obama of worsening the racial situation.

“If anyone has stoked racial hatred and divisiveness it’s you and your self-proclaimed wingman Attorney General Eric Holder, running off to Ferguson, attacking all law enforcement, whenever there’s a death, even before there’s any investigation,” said Pirro.

And the response from former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu was even worse.

“What is this damn fool doing coming out of retirement to break with the tradition of not attacking sitting presidents? That was my first thought,” said Sununu on “FOX News.”

He added that Obama had “an insufferable ego.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Candace-Owens-e1525094376844.jpg

By Peter West

Last week, the Trump administration was rocked by a New York Times Op-Ed which accused the president of being clueless about the inner workings of government. The op-ed came on the heels of Bob Woodward’s “Fear,” a book that exposed the chaotic inner workings of the Trump White House.

Trump supporters considered the op-ed a direct attack on the president and are calling for the most severe punishment.

“The author of the NY Times op-ed is obviously a traitorous, communist, liberal and deserves to be executed,” said far-right radio talk show host Michael Savage on his show.

Trump also seems to support Savage’s view. He called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the author for treason, a crime punishable by death.

“Number one, the Times should never have done that, because really what they’ve done is virtually, you know, it’s treason, you could call it a lot of things,” said Trump during a campaign rally.

However, the president’s crazed response only seem to prove Woodward’s allegation correct. According to Time, Trump doesn’t understand the meaning of the word treason.

“His use of the term ‘treason’ – defined as ‘the crime of betraying one’s country, especially by attempting to kill or overthrow the sovereign or government’ – echoes a tweet he posted not long after the Times published the op-ed, reading simply ‘TREASON?’” said Billy Perrigo.

However, publishing a critical article doesn’t meet the definition of treason.

CNN’s Chris Cuomo said Trump’s over-the-top response to the editorial was disturbing.

“What the president has done in reaction to the last two days screams concern that he’s dealing with the truth. With him going on a hunt in the White House for who talked to Woodward. For him saying ‘The New York Times’ has to turn over their source to the government as a matter of national security? Do you realize how crazy that notion is, to even suggest, let alone from a president?” said Cuomo."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MichaelSavage.jpg

As President Donald Trump continues to unravel in front of our eyes, his supporters are only digging in deeper.

Earlier this week, Trump gave another rambling campaign speech in Billings, Mont. where he mispronounced “anonymous.” But his supporters dismissed the fact the president of the United States is slurring his words.

A poster in a Trump-supporting Facebook group suggested that Trump mangling his words is a sign of his intelligence.

“Sometimes people who are hyper intelligent stutter because their minds are working so fast,” said Bill Keane, a member of the “Make America White” Facebook group. “Trump is a stable genius.”

But Keane is not alone in his worship of the barely-sane Trump.

FOX News “psychologist” Gina Loudon also sang his praises on Sean Hannity’s show. Loudon discredited Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” which painted the Trump White House as a sea of chaos.

“Woodward doesn’t know the president. I don’t know how many graduate courses he’s taken in psychology … I know his family and I know the people around him. I’ve seen him relaxing … I’ve seen him in the White House and you know him. You know how focused he is, how much he’s enjoying his job … and how unaffected he is by them,” said Loudon. “My book actually uses science and real data and true psychological theory to explain why it is quite possible that this president is the most sound-minded person to ever occupy the White House.”

However, while Loudon may vouch for the president’s mental stability, Trump continues to show people he is completely unfit for the job of commander-in-chief. Woodward’s book and the recent New York Times anonymous op-ed, both accuse Trump of being clueless about how government functions.

In response to the New York Times article, Trump has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the paper and look at treason charges."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Donald_Trump_with_supporters_27151781553.jpg

FOX News troll Jesse Watters claims President Donald Trump may have dirt on Special Counsel Robert Muller.

“There’s something personal between the president and Muller,” said Watters. “Maybe Mueller’s hiding something? Could the president have possession of a sex tape?”

Watters views are in line with Trump’s. Earlier this week, the president claimed he had incriminating pictures of Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey.

“But I had a business dispute with Mueller before that. I had a real business dispute. And he’s Comey’s best friend. And I could give you 100 pictures of him and Comey hugging and kissing each other. You know, he’s Comey’s best friend,” said Trump in an interview with neo-fascist rag, The Daily Caller.

The president has increasingly begun to go off the rails as he is buffeted from scandals from all sides, dismal poll ratings and Bob Woodward’s White House expose, “Fear.”

Earlier this week, the White House was rocked when an insider published an anonymous op ed in the New York Times claiming Trump was so out of control, staff members often hide things from him.

Woodward’s book also backed these claims. He wrote that Defense Secretary Gen. (rtd.) James Mattis had hidden a briefing from the president. Woodward also claimed that Trump had given an order to kill the entire Syrian administration.

British newspaper the Independent recently reported on excerpts from the book.

“After Bashar al-Assad launched a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017, Mr Trump is reported to have told his defence secretary he wanted the Syrian president assassinated. “Mr. Woodward’s alleges that the US leader called James Mattis and said: ‘Let’s f***ing kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the f***ing lot of them,” said the Independent. “Mr Mattis told Mr Trump he would ‘get right on it’, but after hanging up the phone he told a senior aide: ‘We’re not going to do any of that. We’re going to be much more measured.’”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jesse-watters-e1489839820352.jpg

As California is being ravaged by one of the worst fire seasons in recent years, preacher Franklin Graham suggested the Golden State may have brought it on itself.

“I prayed over the issue and the message I got is California is being punished by God for its disobedience,” said Graham in a Charisma magazine interview. “California was the first state to legalize gay marriage and it has also been extremely defiant towards President Trump, now look at the situation they’re in.”

Graham’s views were shared by Kevin Swanson, another fundamentalist preacher.

“In 2011, California became the first state to mandate homosexual indoctrination for K-8 students and then, in 2012, California became the first state to sign a ban on therapy that was attempting to convert homosexuals into non-homosexuals. And then, in 2017, the California state schools implemented the homosexual indoctrination program … and that was the kickoff for the biggest fires that California has ever seen in its history,” said Swanson on “Generations” radio.“So God is burning down California in 2017 and 2018 after about 25 years of leading the pack to legitimize the sin of homosexuality in that state.”

In other news, the “stable genius” president continued to show his ignorance and aversion to reading in a comment about the fires. Trump claimed California’s policies were making the fires worse.

“California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,” said Trump in a tweet. “It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!”

According to ThinkProgress, this comment was ridiculed by water and climate expert Peter Gleick.

“California’s forests are burning because of past severe drought and current extreme temperatures and weather, worsened by human-caused climate change, which you think, in your fantasy world, doesn’t exist,” said Gleick.

He also called Trump’s views “gobbledygook bulls**t” and “unmitigated crap.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Franklin-Graham-bible-e1519088578532.jpg

U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) appeared on “Sunday Morning Futures” with host Maria Bartiromo and stated his intentions to make all the depositions taken in the Russia investigation public before the midterm elections.



Russiagate’s ‘Game of Thrones’: The ongoing partisan fued between Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Devin Nunes may soon be coming to an end with the stroke of Trump’s pen.

“I think full transparency is in order here, so I expect to make those available from our committee to the American public here in the next few weeks,” the congressman said in the interview with Bartiromo.

Nunes also said Americans deserve this level of transparency for an investigation that has obstructed the Trump administration’s agenda, and a large number of Americans “have drank this Russia Kool-Aid” as a result.

On Monday, President Trump did in fact order the declassifying of several key documents, just as Nunes had predicted in the interview.

Jeff Carlson, CPA, posted the two interview segments as well as a recap of the points made by Nunes to his blog and this tweet:

More from Jeff Carlson’s “Devin Nunes & 70 Depositions” below…

Devin Nunes appeared on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo in two separate segments today. Several revelations were made – and virtually every word was important.

It truly was an amazing interview.

Nunes disclosed that over 70 depositions of individuals have occurred – and been recorded. This is new information

This is new information Nunes wants to make all of these depositions public.

Approximately 70% of these interviews are already declassified.

Nunes intends to send the remaining classified transcripts to DNI Coats for declassification shortly.

Nunes expects to obtain declassification.

Nunes expects to make the transcripts available to the American public within the next few weeks – before the mid-term elections.

Nunes believes President Trump will declassify the Carter Page FISA & Bruce Ohr documents – before the mid-term elections.

The FBI & DOJ were both directly involved in leaking fake news stories.

The planted news stories were used as a pretext to interview American citizens.

Planted news stories were used to corroborate the Page FISA to the FISA Court.

There was an unprecedented level of cooperation & coordination between the Clinton Campaign, Fusion GPS, the FBI & DOJ and the Department of State.

Nunes references 2-3 dozen reporters as being fed fake stories from these sources.

These stories were then disseminated to use as the basis for an investigation.

Bartiromo closes with this warning:

If the House flips in November, you will no longer be the Chairman, perhaps your colleague on the Left, Adam Schiff, may very well be. We won’t hear another word about this story.

You can watch two video clips below. For partial transcripts, go here.

Clip #1, ‘Russiagate’ interview starts at 5 minute mark:

Clip #2, Nunes describes the ‘planting of fake news stories’ by the FBI and others:

In November, incumbent politicians pouring the ‘Russia Kool-Aid’ on the American people will be faced with tough questions from their constituencies like ‘What have you been doing for the last two years?’

And if all the depositions in the Russia investigation are indeed declassified and released to the public before midterms, as Chairman Nunes intends, the entire ‘Russiagate’ narrative, the Mueller probe, and the Democrats’ grand plans for a ‘blue wave’ flip of the U.S. House could all come crashing down. This is important.

884307c29fc344cf93473e4a35c67d2f	[]	2018-09-15 00:00:00	Erdogan, Putin to Meet Monday in Sochi as Turkey Moves More Weapons into Syria	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Erdogan, Putin to Meet Monday in Sochi as Turkey Moves More Weapons into Syria	0	"By

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to meet Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Sochi on Monday, amid reports of a heavy Turkish arms drop into Syria in recent days.

The two leaders last met at a summit earlier this month in Tehran, and this next meeting will come just days after the Turkish army sent more ‘arms and ammunition’ into Syria’s Idlib and Hama provinces, according to a report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) released on Saturday.

The independent media outlet Muraselon is also citing multiple reports of both Turkish weapons and troops moving into these regions, including to areas under the control of the ‘rebel’ coalition National Liberation Front (NLF) – a collection of unsavory characters and the main rival of Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) in Idlib, according to IRIN:

Turkey’s favourite is the NLF, which is led by Fadlallah al-Hajji, a Muslim Brotherhood ally. The NLF includes Turkey-friendly Islamists like Ahrar al-Sham, the Noureddine al-Zengi Brigades, Failaq al-Sham, Jaish al-Ahrar, and groups that fought under the Free Syrian Army banner, like the Victory Army and the 2nd Coastal Division. Big but brittle, the NLF is held together by Turkish sponsorship and shared enemies: al-Assad’s government, Syrian Kurdish groups, and hardline jihadists.

Turkey’s escalated military presence and heavy arms drop into known jihadist havens ahead of the upcoming Sochi meeting is unwelcome, and presents the potential risk for a military showdown in the future between Turkish and Syrian/Russian forces – something that all sides have warned against but Turkey’s apparent ‘double-dealing’ isn’t helping.

Peter Ford, former British Ambassador to Syria, with a rather useful media guide, aptly described as, “The Dirty Dozen: 12 lies they tell you to anaesthetise you for the upcoming bombing of Syria.”

Peter Ford

21st Century Wire

The propaganda mills of the British and American governments – spokespersons, media, think tanks – are working overtime churning out ‘talking points’ to justify the upcoming large scale bombing of Syria on the pretext of use of prohibited weapons.

Here is a guide from a former insider to the top dozen of these lies.

1. There are more babies than jihadis in Idlib. As it happens this gem of moral blackmail is untrue. There are twice as many jihadis (about 100,000) as babies (0-1 year) (55,000). What is this factoid meant to say anyway? Don’t try to free an area of jihadis because you might harm a lot of children? The Western coalition scarcely heeded that consideration in razing Mosul and Raqqa in order to crush ISIS. They are still pulling babies out of the rubble in Raqqa.

2. The reports [of the imminent chemical weapons ‘attack’] must be true because Assad has done it before. False. Since 2013 when Assad gave up chemical weapons under supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) the OPCW have not visited the sites of alleged attacks in jihadi-controlled areas but have accepted at face value ‘reports’ from pro-jihadi organisations like the White Helmets and the Syrian American Medical Society, along with ‘evidence’ from hostile intelligence agencies. In the case of the one site the OPCW did visit, Douma, their report said they found no evidence of sarin, no untoward traces in any of the blood samples taken from ‘alleged victims’ (their term), no bodies and only ambiguous evidence of use of chlorine.

3. The OPCW report on Douma was flawed because the Russians and Syrians caused delay. False. As documented in the OPCW report, delay was caused by UN bureaucracy and jihadi snipers. The inspectors do not say their findings were to any significant degree invalidated by the delay.

4. Assad uses chemical weapons because they frighten large numbers of people into fleeing. False. They don’t. This desperate argument is trotted out to counter the fact that Assad would have to be stupid to use chemical weapons knowing what the result would be and that he would derive minimal military benefit.

5. The OPCW won’t be able to investigate because it won’t be safe. A feeble excuse to preempt calls for establishing facts before bombing. The Turks escort Western journalists into Idlib.

10. There are going to be massacres, a bloodbath, or ‘genocide’. False. We heard all this hysteria before Aleppo, before Eastern Ghouta and before the campaign in the South. All vastly exaggerated. The Syrian Arab Army has not been responsible for a single massacre, while the jihadis have been responsible for many (source: quarterly reports of the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria).

11. People have nowhere to go. False. The Russians have opened safe corridors but the jihadis are not allowing people to leave. They can still leave for the northern border strip which Turkey controls, where there are camps, and many (including jihadi fighters) will be able to cross temporarily into Turkey.

12. We can’t tell you which armed groups we support because it would make them targets for Assad. Really? You think he doesn’t know? Isn’t it because you are terrified it will come out that we have been supporting some real head-choppers?

More Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy films, this time from a border-crossing controlled by Turkish-backed and FSA ‘rebel’ forces in northwestern Aleppo.

Al Masdar News reports…

BEIRUT, LEBANON (1:20 P.M.) – A Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy filmed from a Turkish border-crossing controlled by the rebel forces in Aleppo recently.

Based on the video that was released by the official media wing of the Tiger Forces, the Syrian Army spy filmed from the border-town of Banes, which is located in northwestern Aleppo.

Banes is located inside the Afrin region, which was fully captured by the Turkish-backed rebels in March of this year.

As shown in the video below, the Syrian Army is filming at a road sign near Turkish border-crossing in the Afrin region:



Prior to the seizure of the Afrin region by the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and their Turkish-backed allies, this area was controlled by the Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG).

Since losing the Afrin region, the YPG’s sleeper cells have been wrecking havoc on the Turkish-backed rebels that were evacuated from the East Ghouta region of Damascus.

By Stephen Lendman

The die is cast in Syria. The mother of all battles to eliminate US-supported terrorists in Idlib province looms.

During a Tuesday Security Council session, Russia’s envoy Vasily Nebenzia repeated what he, Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov, and Syrian UN envoy Bashar al-Jaafari stressed earlier.

“(U)ndeniable proof” shows US-supported terrorists and White Helmets infesting Idlib intend staging a false flag CW attack on civilians used as props – the staged incident to be wrongfully blamed on Damascus.

It’s one of the oldest most despicable dirty tricks in the book, used to launch wars based on Big Lies or escalate them.

The same ugly stunt occurred before. Not a shred of credible evidence suggests Syrian forces ever used CWs any time throughout the war – or that it retains any now.

Its entire stockpile was eliminated. On June 17, 2015, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) headlined “Disposal of effluents from neutralized Syrian chemical weapons completed,” saying:

The OPCW “welcomes the completion of disposal of effluents resulting from neutralization operations aboard the US vessel Cape Ray.”

“These operations governed the destruction at sea of almost 600 metric tonnes of sulphur mustard and methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF) from Syria’s chemical weapons programme. DF is a key precursor chemical for manufacturing nerve agent.”

At the time, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu called the above efforts “yet another milestone on the path to eliminating chemical weapons stocks from Syria…”

US-supported terrorist alone used chemical and other toxic agents numerous times throughout the war – banned substances supplied by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and perhaps other countries.

Pentagon contractors in Jordan trained US-supported terrorists in the use of CWs, likely still doing it.

Syrian forces liberated most parts of the country using conventional weapons alone, greatly aided by Russian airpower – their operations entirely legal.

During Tuesday’s Security Council session, Russian UN envoy Nebenzia clearly explained that “the use of chemical weapons by Damascus has no military grounds and is harmful from the military and political point of view as it would be an invitation for the Western trio to attack Syria,” adding:

Permitting what Sergey Lavrov called an “abscess” to remain in Idlib is absolutely unacceptable.

On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said “(w)e cannot let Idlib remain a terrorist stronghold.”

A US/UK orchestrated CW false flag in Idlib is imminent. On Tuesday, Russia’s reconciliation center in Syria said the following:

“According to the information received from inhabitants of Idlib province, (US-supported terrorists and White Helmets) are now filming a staged provocation in the city of Jisr al-Shugur, where ‘chemical weapons’ are depicted as being used by the Syrian army against civilians.”

“The film crews of several Middle Eastern TV channels arrived in Jisr al-Shugur in the morning, as well as the regional affiliate of one of the main American television news networks.”

“The plot envisages staged scenes showing ‘activists’ from the…’White Helmets’ ‘helping’ the residents of Jisr al-Shughur after the Syrian army allegedly used the so-called barrel bombs with poisonous substances.”

“All the footage of the staged provocation in Jisr al-Shughur is to be delivered to the newsrooms of TV channels, which are to broadcast it after its publication on social media.”

In preparation for the false flag, canisters of weaponized chlorine were delivered to the planned crime scene.

Ahead of the incident, media scoundrels disgracefully claimed Assad approved use of chlorine gas (and possibly deadly sarin) in Idlib – a Big Lie, citing unnamed US sources.

Naked aggression is always based on lies repeated ad nauseam, getting most people to believe what anyone following reliable reliable independent sources of news, information and analysis knows is untrue.

The stage is set in Idlib – another CW false flag imminent – the incident to be used by the US, UK and France to terror-bomb Syrian sites, likely more aggressively than earlier.

How Russia intends responding to the scheme remains unknown. Its numerous warships in the region and state-of-the-art missile defense in Syria can neutralize a US-led attack when launched.

Much rides on whether and how it may challenge the Trump regime’s aim to prevent Idlib’s liberation, along with wanting sovereign Syria replaced by pro-Western puppet rule.

21WIRE’s Vanessa Beeley has reported from Syria that ISIS has moved into Idlib, arriving in the city of Jisr Al Shughour which is close to the border of Latakia:

“Haras Al Deen is coalition of Nusra Front #AlQaeda & ISIS fighters who arrived in Jisr Al Shughour 3 days ago suspected to be fm Iraq via Turkey. 2000 strong force. Territory extends to North of Lattakia” via @khalediskef #ldlib @21WIRE — vanessa beeley (@VanessaBeeley) September 11, 2018

This is the ‘carte blanche’ U.S. forces need to muscle into Idlib on the back of their self-styled mandate for occupying Syria which is to “Fight ISIS.” Recent statements from the U.S. about possibly intervening in Idlib may have alluded to this very possibility. Such a move by U.S. would exacerbate an already tense situation between the Syrian and Russian coalition at attempting to liberate the province from its al-Qaeda led terrorist occupation. The US have also deployed a detachment of combat Marines into Syria this week. Add to this, a confused Turkey who is torn between the rebel-terrorists groups it’s been hosting and supporting for the last 7 years and wanting to also eliminate any Kurdish opposition in northern Syria – while trying to maintain a respectable face with its Astana and NATO partners.

A staged chemical stunt may not be needed by the US to intervene in Idlib, if instead ‘ISIS’ becomes the US imperative, thus using the cut-out bait terror group to justify the ongoing US disruption and illegal ‘train and equip’ operations in Syria. As long as ISIS fighters are there, so are U.S. forces – such is official Washington’s public-facing policy.

All of the outrage about an “impending massacre” in Idlib may also be a ploy so Turkey and the U.S. can both move in to take up positions and thus allowing al-Qaeda/ Nusra and other terrorists to extend their occupation of key parts of the province – which will of course only extend the war, along with both U.S. and Turkish illegal occupations in Syria.

The propaganda mills of the British and American governments – spokespersons, media, think tanks – are working overtime churning out ‘talking points’ to justify the upcoming large scale bombing of Syria on the pretext of use of prohibited weapons.

Here is a guide from a former insider to the top dozen of these lies.

1. There are more babies than jihadis in Idlib. As it happens this gem of moral blackmail is untrue. There are twice as many jihadis (about 100,000) as babies (0-1 year) (55,000). What is this factoid meant to say anyway? Don’t try to free an area of jihadis because you might harm a lot of children? The Western coalition scarcely heeded that consideration in razing Mosul and Raqqa in order to crush ISIS. They are still pulling babies out of the rubble in Raqqa.

2. The reports [of the imminent chemical weapons ‘attack’] must be true because Assad has done it before. False. Since 2013 when Assad gave up chemical weapons under supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) the OPCW have not visited the sites of alleged attacks in jihadi-controlled areas but have accepted at face value ‘reports’ from pro-jihadi organisations like the White Helmets and the Syrian American Medical Society, along with ‘evidence’ from hostile intelligence agencies. In the case of the one site the OPCW did visit, Douma, their report said they found no evidence of sarin, no untoward traces in any of the blood samples taken from ‘alleged victims’ (their term), no bodies and only ambiguous evidence of use of chlorine.

3. The OPCW report on Douma was flawed because the Russians and Syrians caused delay. False. As documented in the OPCW report, delay was caused by UN bureaucracy and jihadi snipers. The inspectors do not say their findings were to any significant degree invalidated by the delay.

4. Assad uses chemical weapons because they frighten large numbers of people into fleeing. False. They don’t. This desperate argument is trotted out to counter the fact that Assad would have to be stupid to use chemical weapons knowing what the result would be and that he would derive minimal military benefit. To date, not one of the alleged chemical attacks has precipitated an exodus any greater than flight caused by the legendary ‘barrel bombs’. The inhabitants of Douma by their own testimonies given to Western journalists were even unaware there might have been an attack until they heard about it in the media.

5. The OPCW won’t be able to investigate because it won’t be safe. A feeble excuse to preempt calls for establishing facts before bombing. The Turks escort Western journalists into Idlib. They have hundreds of troops there and the jihadis kowtow to them because they control all logistics. The Turks could escort OPCW. And wouldn’t the jihadis be keener than anybody for the inspectors to visit if their claims were true?

6. The upcoming strikes are not aimed at regime change. False. The plan is to decapitate the Syrian state with attacks on the presidency. Failing that the aim is to make Idlib a quagmire for the Russians. Anything to deprive Asad and Putin of victory, regardless of whether it prolongs the war.

7. It’s all Russian disinformation. Yeah, like the arms inspectors before the Iraq war who said no WMD in Iraq. Reality: the Russians have got great intelligence on what Western powers with their jihadi clients are up to and are calling out the phoney moves.

8. There won’t be enough time for parliamentary debate. Pull the other one. Reality: the government are terrified of a rerun of 2013 when Labour and 30 brave Tory MPs voted against bombing, causing Cameron and then Obama to back off.

9. MPs can’t be told what is planned because it would jeopardise the safety of service personnel. How low can you stoop? Feigning concern for flyers when it’s really just about keeping the people in ignorance of how big the strikes are going to be.

10. There are going to be massacres, a bloodbath, or ‘genocide’. False. We heard all this hysteria before Aleppo, before Eastern Ghouta and before the campaign in the South. All vastly exaggerated. The Syrian Arab Army has not been responsible for a single massacre, while the jihadis have been responsible for many (source: quarterly reports of the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria).

U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) appeared on “Sunday Morning Futures” with host Maria Bartiromo and stated his intentions to make all the depositions taken in the Russia investigation public before the midterm elections.



Russiagate’s ‘Game of Thrones’: The ongoing partisan fued between Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Devin Nunes may soon be coming to an end with the stroke of Trump’s pen.

“I think full transparency is in order here, so I expect to make those available from our committee to the American public here in the next few weeks,” the congressman said in the interview with Bartiromo.

Nunes also said Americans deserve this level of transparency for an investigation that has obstructed the Trump administration’s agenda, and a large number of Americans “have drank this Russia Kool-Aid” as a result.

On Monday, President Trump did in fact order the declassifying of several key documents, just as Nunes had predicted in the interview.

Jeff Carlson, CPA, posted the two interview segments as well as a recap of the points made by Nunes to his blog and this tweet:

1) Some interviews are more important than others.

@DevinNunes appeared on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo in two separate segments today. Several revelations were made – and virtually every word was important.

More from Jeff Carlson’s “Devin Nunes & 70 Depositions” below…

Devin Nunes appeared on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo in two separate segments today. Several revelations were made – and virtually every word was important.

It truly was an amazing interview.

Nunes disclosed that over 70 depositions of individuals have occurred – and been recorded. This is new information

This is new information Nunes wants to make all of these depositions public.

Approximately 70% of these interviews are already declassified.

Nunes intends to send the remaining classified transcripts to DNI Coats for declassification shortly.

Nunes expects to obtain declassification.

Nunes expects to make the transcripts available to the American public within the next few weeks – before the mid-term elections.

Nunes believes President Trump will declassify the Carter Page FISA & Bruce Ohr documents – before the mid-term elections.

The FBI & DOJ were both directly involved in leaking fake news stories.

The planted news stories were used as a pretext to interview American citizens.

Planted news stories were used to corroborate the Page FISA to the FISA Court.

There was an unprecedented level of cooperation & coordination between the Clinton Campaign, Fusion GPS, the FBI & DOJ and the Department of State.

Nunes references 2-3 dozen reporters as being fed fake stories from these sources.

These stories were then disseminated to use as the basis for an investigation.

Bartiromo closes with this warning:

If the House flips in November, you will no longer be the Chairman, perhaps your colleague on the Left, Adam Schiff, may very well be. We won’t hear another word about this story.

***

You can watch two video clips below. For partial transcripts, go here.

Clip #1, ‘Russiagate’ interview starts at 5 minute mark:

Clip #2, Nunes describes the ‘planting of fake news stories’ by the FBI and others:

In November, incumbent politicians pouring the ‘Russia Kool-Aid’ on the American people will be faced with tough questions from their constituencies like ‘What have you been doing for the last two years?’

And if all the depositions in the Russia investigation are indeed declassified and released to the public before midterms, as Chairman Nunes intends, the entire ‘Russiagate’ narrative, the Mueller probe, and the Democrats’ grand plans for a ‘blue wave’ flip of the U.S. House could all come crashing down. This is important.

The two leaders last met at a summit earlier this month in Tehran, and this next meeting will come just days after the Turkish army sent more ‘arms and ammunition’ into Syria’s Idlib and Hama provinces, according to a report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) released on Saturday.

The independent media outlet Muraselon is also citing multiple reports of both Turkish weapons and troops moving into these regions, including to areas under the control of the ‘rebel’ coalition National Liberation Front (NLF) – a collection of unsavory characters and the main rival of Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) in Idlib, according to IRIN:

Turkey’s favourite is the NLF, which is led by Fadlallah al-Hajji, a Muslim Brotherhood ally. The NLF includes Turkey-friendly Islamists like Ahrar al-Sham, the Noureddine al-Zengi Brigades, Failaq al-Sham, Jaish al-Ahrar, and groups that fought under the Free Syrian Army banner, like the Victory Army and the 2nd Coastal Division. Big but brittle, the NLF is held together by Turkish sponsorship and shared enemies: al-Assad’s government, Syrian Kurdish groups, and hardline jihadists.

Turkey’s escalated military presence and heavy arms drop into known jihadist havens ahead of the upcoming Sochi meeting is unwelcome, and presents the potential risk for a military showdown in the future between Turkish and Syrian/Russian forces – something that all sides have warned against but Turkey’s apparent ‘double-dealing’ isn’t helping.

More Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy films, this time from a border-crossing controlled by Turkish-backed and FSA ‘rebel’ forces in northwestern Aleppo.

BEIRUT, LEBANON (1:20 P.M.) – A Syrian Arab Army (SAA) spy filmed from a Turkish border-crossing controlled by the rebel forces in Aleppo recently.

Based on the video that was released by the official media wing of the Tiger Forces, the Syrian Army spy filmed from the border-town of Banes, which is located in northwestern Aleppo.

Banes is located inside the Afrin region, which was fully captured by the Turkish-backed rebels in March of this year.

As shown in the video below, the Syrian Army is filming at a road sign near Turkish border-crossing in the Afrin region:



Prior to the seizure of the Afrin region by the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and their Turkish-backed allies, this area was controlled by the Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG).

Since losing the Afrin region, the YPG’s sleeper cells have been wrecking havoc on the Turkish-backed rebels that were evacuated from the East Ghouta region of Damascus.

By Stephen Lendman

The die is cast in Syria. The mother of all battles to eliminate US-supported terrorists in Idlib province looms.

During a Tuesday Security Council session, Russia’s envoy Vasily Nebenzia repeated what he, Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov, and Syrian UN envoy Bashar al-Jaafari stressed earlier.

“(U)ndeniable proof” shows US-supported terrorists and White Helmets infesting Idlib intend staging a false flag CW attack on civilians used as props – the staged incident to be wrongfully blamed on Damascus.

It’s one of the oldest most despicable dirty tricks in the book, used to launch wars based on Big Lies or escalate them.

The same ugly stunt occurred before. Not a shred of credible evidence suggests Syrian forces ever used CWs any time throughout the war – or that it retains any now.

Its entire stockpile was eliminated. On June 17, 2015, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) headlined “Disposal of effluents from neutralized Syrian chemical weapons completed,” saying:

The OPCW “welcomes the completion of disposal of effluents resulting from neutralization operations aboard the US vessel Cape Ray.”

“These operations governed the destruction at sea of almost 600 metric tonnes of sulphur mustard and methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF) from Syria’s chemical weapons programme. DF is a key precursor chemical for manufacturing nerve agent.”

At the time, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu called the above efforts “yet another milestone on the path to eliminating chemical weapons stocks from Syria…”

US-supported terrorist alone used chemical and other toxic agents numerous times throughout the war – banned substances supplied by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and perhaps other countries.

Pentagon contractors in Jordan trained US-supported terrorists in the use of CWs, likely still doing it.

Syrian forces liberated most parts of the country using conventional weapons alone, greatly aided by Russian airpower – their operations entirely legal.

During Tuesday’s Security Council session, Russian UN envoy Nebenzia clearly explained that “the use of chemical weapons by Damascus has no military grounds and is harmful from the military and political point of view as it would be an invitation for the Western trio to attack Syria,” adding:

Permitting what Sergey Lavrov called an “abscess” to remain in Idlib is absolutely unacceptable.

On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said “(w)e cannot let Idlib remain a terrorist stronghold.”

A US/UK orchestrated CW false flag in Idlib is imminent. On Tuesday, Russia’s reconciliation center in Syria said the following:

“According to the information received from inhabitants of Idlib province, (US-supported terrorists and White Helmets) are now filming a staged provocation in the city of Jisr al-Shugur, where ‘chemical weapons’ are depicted as being used by the Syrian army against civilians.”

“The film crews of several Middle Eastern TV channels arrived in Jisr al-Shugur in the morning, as well as the regional affiliate of one of the main American television news networks.”

“The plot envisages staged scenes showing ‘activists’ from the…’White Helmets’ ‘helping’ the residents of Jisr al-Shughur after the Syrian army allegedly used the so-called barrel bombs with poisonous substances.”

“All the footage of the staged provocation in Jisr al-Shughur is to be delivered to the newsrooms of TV channels, which are to broadcast it after its publication on social media.”

In preparation for the false flag, canisters of weaponized chlorine were delivered to the planned crime scene.

Ahead of the incident, media scoundrels disgracefully claimed Assad approved use of chlorine gas (and possibly deadly sarin) in Idlib – a Big Lie, citing unnamed US sources.

Naked aggression is always based on lies repeated ad nauseam, getting most people to believe what anyone following reliable reliable independent sources of news, information and analysis knows is untrue.

The stage is set in Idlib – another CW false flag imminent – the incident to be used by the US, UK and France to terror-bomb Syrian sites, likely more aggressively than earlier.

How Russia intends responding to the scheme remains unknown. Its numerous warships in the region and state-of-the-art missile defense in Syria can neutralize a US-led attack when launched.

Much rides on whether and how it may challenge the Trump regime’s aim to prevent Idlib’s liberation, along with wanting sovereign Syria replaced by pro-Western puppet rule.

21WIRE’s Vanessa Beeley has reported from Syria that ISIS has moved into Idlib, arriving in the city of Jisr Al Shughour which is close to the border of Latakia:

“Haras Al Deen is coalition of Nusra Front #AlQaeda & ISIS fighters who arrived in Jisr Al Shughour 3 days ago suspected to be fm Iraq via Turkey. 2000 strong force. Territory extends to North of Lattakia” via @khalediskef #ldlib @21WIRE — vanessa beeley (@VanessaBeeley) September 11, 2018

This is the ‘carte blanche’ U.S. forces need to muscle into Idlib on the back of their self-styled mandate for occupying Syria which is to “Fight ISIS.” Recent statements from the U.S. about possibly intervening in Idlib may have alluded to this very possibility. Such a move by U.S. would exacerbate an already tense situation between the Syrian and Russian coalition at attempting to liberate the province from its al-Qaeda led terrorist occupation. The US have also deployed a detachment of combat Marines into Syria this week. Add to this, a confused Turkey who is torn between the rebel-terrorists groups it’s been hosting and supporting for the last 7 years and wanting to also eliminate any Kurdish opposition in northern Syria – while trying to maintain a respectable face with its Astana and NATO partners.

A staged chemical stunt may not be needed by the US to intervene in Idlib, if instead ‘ISIS’ becomes the US imperative, thus using the cut-out bait terror group to justify the ongoing US disruption and illegal ‘train and equip’ operations in Syria. As long as ISIS fighters are there, so are U.S. forces – such is official Washington’s public-facing policy.

All of the outrage about an “impending massacre” in Idlib may also be a ploy so Turkey and the U.S. can both move in to take up positions and thus allowing al-Qaeda/ Nusra and other terrorists to extend their occupation of key parts of the province – which will of course only extend the war, along with both U.S. and Turkish illegal occupations in Syria.

The US Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday requested that WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange testify on Russian ‘meddling’ in the 2016 election.

The ‘mutually agreed upon time and location’ also comes with the strict condition from Assange’s legal team that “testimony must conform to a high ethical standard,” according to this Wikileaks tweet:

BREAKING: US Senate Intelligence Committee calls editor @JulianAssange to testify. Letter delivered via US embassy in London.

A meeting between the Wikileaks publisher and the US Senate Intelligence Committee has the potential to put the entire ‘Russiagate’ investigation in jeopardy because it “hinges on conspiracy,” 21WIRE’s Patrick Henningsen told RT. Watch:



If Assange does testify, he could completely destroy the US narrative on Russian ‘meddling’ and interference:

Others in independent media, including mega entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, have speculated that this event would bring the entire ‘Russia hoax’ to its conclusion:

Julian Assange has finally been asked to testify to the US Senate about ‘Russian interference’ in the 2016 US election. The Clinton funded Russia hoax is coming to an end. His name was #SethRich — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 8, 2018

Can this meeting be trusted? Is it being used to somehow compromise Assange’s refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London? There are major ethical concerns here. Earlier this summer, several US Democratic Senators signed on to revoke his asylum status:

For burgeoning technocrats, it seems that the Establishment’s contrived ‘fake news crisis‘ is the gift that just keeps on giving. As Facebook moves into its latest Orwellian phase of political censorship, critics are beginning to ask what will become of the Silicon Valley’s most famous digital monopoly. Has Facebook sold out its user base? Will intelligent and influential content producers and consumers now begin migrating in greater numbers to more Constitutional or free speech-friendly social media platforms? Sputnik Radio’s cutting edge program Trend Storm explores this question with special guests, 21WIRE’s Patrick Henningsen and Joaquin Flores, Editor-in-Chief of Fort Russ News.

If the British then hand over Assange to the US, he will face an uncertain fate which could range from a military tribunal, to federal imprisonment, or even the death penalty for the high crimes of espionage and treason.

Moreno was not shy about his own bias in the case saying, “I’ve never agreed with the activity Mr. Assange performs, I’ve never agreed with the intervention in people’s emails to obtain information despite how valuable it is to shed light on some undesirable acts by governments and people… There are correct and legal ways to it.”

Professor Piers Robinson, Co-Director of the Organisation for Propaganda Studies, and Chair in Politics, Society and Political Journalism at the University of Sheffield, spoke to Sky News about the Skripal case, Russia and Syria, reiterating that ‘more evidence is needed’ before the British government’s claims can be legitimately stood up:

“We are being asked to place faith and trust in Theresa May and the intelligence services but we haven’t actually been presented with the facts and the evidence which actually does confirm the claim that’s being made. So we really need to step back and look for more, and as some of the representatives in UN Security Council were saying yesterday we need to really have more evidence before this claim can be stood up if there is the evidence to support the fact that is was certainly GRU.”

Robinson also addressed the ‘dangerous politicization’ some British diplomats may use in an attempt to conflate the Skripal affair and the situation in Syria:

“We also need to be very aware that this might become politicized and used as part of accusations and claims being made in the context Syria. And I would add that Karen Pierce did actually make that link herself in the discussion with journalists after the UN Security Council meeting yesterday, where she talked about Russia and the Syrian government and international norms, etc.”

In a recent online interview, Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg talks about the possibility of Julian Assange being tried in the US under the Espionage Act for publishing classified material.

Joe Lauria, Editor in Chief of Consortium News, spoke to Ellsberg during an ‘online vigil’ for the WikiLeaks founder and editor organized by Unity4J.com.

The online interview series has featured Bill Binney, Jimmy Dore, Kim Dotcom, George Galloway, Chris Hedges, Caitlin Johnstone, Peter Lavelle, Daniel McAdams, Ray McGovern, Cynthia McKinney, Craig Murray, Mark Sleboda and many others.

In the interview, Ellsberg lays out his case for why Assange can’t be tried fairly under the Espionage Act. The whistleblower emeritus said because Assange was the publisher of the classified material, not technically the whistleblower, he was in effect a journalist.

“The stakes here are nothing less than freedom of the press,” Ellsberg concluded.

Towards the end of the interview, Lauria also throws a wildcard scenario on the table for how Assange might become a ‘free man’ – stepping out onto the streets of London with the help of Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met for a summit outside Berlin last weekend. Here’s a recap of the event from Strategic Culture…

Peter Korzun

Strategic Culture

Russian President Vladimir Putin has wound up his European trip to include the Austrian FM’s wedding ceremony and talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The drop-in visit to Austria showed that Putin enjoys good personal relations with the representatives of Europe’s political beau monde. They see nothing odd in inviting him to social events, such as the wedding of Austrian FM Karin Kneissl, especially if the organizers want to grab the media spotlight.

This was followed by a summit with the German chancellor — the second time the two leaders have met in just over three months. The previous meeting took place in the Black Sea city of Sochi in May. The chancellor has visited Russia several times.

The “Meseberg Castle talks” in Germany were substantive and detailed, as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has noted, but evidently important enough that few details were made public. For some time the leaders talked tête-à-tête without interpreters. They compared notes on Ukraine (including the prospects for a UN-sponsored peace mission and the EU’s new role of mediator), Syria (and the problems of its reconstruction), the US sanctions on Iran, and the future of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas-pipeline project.

There were no agreements planned for the meeting, but the “America First” policy is pushing these two countries that are divided by their different views on international issues toward a closer cooperation. Russia can play a very important role in creating the right conditions under which the Syrian refugees could leave Germany and return home, thus mitigating that pressing problem. Syria’s reconstruction is opening up new opportunities for Russian-German cooperation.

President Putin and Chancellor Merkel discussed the idea of a meeting on Syria involving the leaders of France and Turkey as well as Russia and Germany. They agreed to launch new talks under this format. No date for that four-nation summit was set.

Some time ago, such a visit to Germany and Austria was hardly conceivable and any hope of reviving a dialog would have seemed far-fetched. The times are changing, reflecting the need to get that relationship back to normal. Conflicts and negative emotions are giving way to cool-headed, constructive approaches. Besides, Russia has demonstrated its ability to resist pressure.

Right on the eve of the Putin-Merkel summit, the Wall Street Journal published an article about the sanctions being prepared by the US to stop Nord Stream 2. It’s time for Germany to stand tall and continue to pursue that project. During the talks with President Putin, Chancellor Merkel said that’s exactly what she is going to do. A cursory look at history supports her position.

In the early 1980s the administration of US President Ronald Reagan was trying to prevent Western Europe and the Soviet Union from working together over energy. Sanctions were used as an instrument to force them into submission. Despite that, the “Brotherhood” pipeline (Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod), also dubbed the Siberian pipeline or the Yamal project, was born in the heat of the Cold War. The framework agreement between West Germany and the USSR was signed in July 1981. Chancellor Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik policy was continued, to everyone’s benefit. In November 1982, the sanctions were lifted, and on January 1, 1984, natural gas started to flow. The similarity between Yamal and Nord Stream 2 is obvious. Resisting pressure benefits the one who refuses to kneel.

Germany is not alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is a strong supporter of Nord Stream 2. The Republic of Austria became the first country in Western Europe to sign a gas contract with the Soviet Union in 1968. In 2017, a new record for Russian gas exports to Austria was set at 9.1 billion cubic meters, an increase of 50.3% (3 billion cubic meters) from 2016 (6.1 billion cubic meters) and 33.8% (2.3 billion cubic meters) from 2005, when the previous record had been reached (6.8 billion cubic meters).

Donald Trump is very critical of the German chancellor, whose government is not as strong as it used to be. The idea to withdraw American forces from Germany has recently been floated. The ongoing rift between the US and its European NATO allies opens up the question of the continent’s security.

Before the July NATO summit, the chancellor came out in support of President Macron’s initiative to create a European expeditionary force. It was Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the current German president and then foreign minister, who launched a European arms–control initiative in 2016. And it was West Germany who signed the Treaty of Moscow with the USSR in August, 1970 which contributed to détente. During the meeting with Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel emphasized that disagreements with Moscow must be resolved through dialog. She feels that there are many conflicts that can be settled if the two nations cooperate.

Indeed, Russia and Germany historically have had a special relationship. They began cooperating economically and working to ease political tensions against the backdrop of confrontation between the West and East. They can do so again. The Meseberg meeting showed that both sides realize the importance of dialog and the need to avoid at all costs any return to the Cold War.

For the last two years, the big tech giants have assured us they were not censoring anyone, adamantly adhering to the American rights of free speech, even testifying to this effect before congress. Of course, anyone with any sense under age 70 knew full well this was total nonsense, but now the coordinated effort of the big tech companies in banning libertarians Alex Jones and Daniel McAdams of the Ron Paul Institute from multiple platforms, as well as other libertarian groups.

Not only have the last two years demonstrated bald faced lying on the part of big tech now revealed as giant spying and censoring operations, Facebook and friends were intended all along to be in this position of censorship to fully control all narratives – political, moral, aesthetic, cultural, as well as election manipulation and market dominance.

The United States is a pop cultural superpower. One can debate if this is for good or for worse – but what is almost indisputable is the amount of resources government institutions ranging from universities to the military and intelligence services place on steering the direction of cultural icons such as musicians and movie stars.

Today Jay Dyer, known for his incisive analysis on propaganda embedded in American films and music, joins us for a discussion on the so called counter-cultural revolution in the 1960s music scene centered around Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. What appears to be an organic, anti-establishment movement led by artists such as Jim Morrison of The Doors is, upon closer examination, co-opted and steered by the very organizations that they publicly condemn. In America, controlled opposition would appear to take many forms. Brought to you by Thermidor Magazine and the Myth 20c Podcast.

The US Department of State announced in a statement today the closure of the office of the General Delegation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Washington, D.C., located at 1732 Wisconsin Ave NW.

“The PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel. To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a US peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise,” the Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said in the official statement.

Here is the official response by the head of the PLO General Delegation, Ambassador Dr. Husam Zomlot:

We condemn in the strongest terms, the US administration’s decision to close the Palestinian mission to the US. However, we are not surprised.

Such a reckless act confirms that the administration is blindly executing Israel’s “wish list,” which starts with shutting down Palestinian diplomatic representation in the US.

The administration’s reasoning for such an act is the refusal of the Palestinian leadership and the PLO Delegation to the US to cooperate with the so-called “peace efforts” and our actions to hold Israel accountable by referring it to the International Criminal Court. We stand firm in our decision not to cooperate in this ongoing campaign to liquidate our rights and cause. Our rights are not for sale and we will block any attempts at bullying and blackmailing us to forgo our legitimate and internationally endorsed rights.

Those who have pushed for such an act are taking a direct aim not only against the Palestinian people and the historic US-Palestinian relationship, but also the prospects for peace in the Middle East and the integrity of the international political and legal system.

The US administration is committing to protect Israel from unlawful acts, and provide it with full immunity to kill the two state-solution, and continue violating basic human and national rights of the people of Palestine, while attacking and undermining the international system of legitimacy and legality.

However, this confirms for us that we are on the right track. We will step up our efforts to hold Israel accountable under international law, continue building international alliances for peace, double our efforts to reach out to the American people as we witness the transformational change in American public opinion in support of the Palestinian cause and our legitimate rights.

While today is a dark day for peace in the Middle East, for multilateralism, and the integrity of the international political and legal system, we will continue our struggle to pursue all possible legal and political means to achieve peace, independence, and our internationally enshrined rights."	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PLO-DC-e1536617346938.jpg

Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) collectively penned an open letter to U.S. President Donald Trump admonishing him to speak now and with authority for Russia and the world to hear – telling the jihadists embedded in Syria that “theirs is a lost cause.”

In the VIPS letter, a range of issues are addressed including the dangerous prospect of “direct Russian-U.S. hostilities” and the unclear nature of U.S. leadership on Syria policy, in particular the role of John Bolton.

The full letter is included below and was originally published to Consortium News:

As Syrian forces backed by Russia launch the final showdown in Syria against jihadist extremists in Idlib province, the potential for a U.S.-Russia confrontation has never been greater, as VIPS warns in this memo to the president. September 9, 2018

MEMORANDUM FOR: The President

FROM: Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity

SUBJECT: Moscow Has Upped the Ante in Syria

Mr. President:

We are concerned that you may not have been adequately briefed on the upsurge of hostilities in northwestern Syria, where Syrian armed forces with Russian support have launched a full-out campaign to take back the al-Nusra/al-Qaeda/ISIS- infested province of Idlib. The Syrians will almost certainly succeed, as they did in late 2016 in Aleppo. As in Aleppo, it will mean unspeakable carnage, unless someone finally tells the insurgents theirs is a lost cause.

That someone is you. The Israelis, Saudis, and others who want unrest to endure are egging on the insurgents, assuring them that you, Mr. President, will use US forces to protect the insurgents in Idlib, and perhaps also rain hell down on Damascus. We believe that your senior advisers are encouraging the insurgents to think in those terms, and that your most senior aides are taking credit for your recent policy shift from troop withdrawal from Syria to indefinite war.

Big Difference This Time

Russian missile-armed naval and air units are now deployed in unprecedented numbers to engage those tempted to interfere with Syrian and Russian forces trying to clean out the terrorists from Idlib. We assume you have been briefed on that — at least to some extent. More important, we know that your advisers tend to be dangerously dismissive of Russian capabilities and intentions.

We do not want you to be surprised when the Russians start firing their missiles. The prospect of direct Russian-U.S. hostilities in Syria is at an all-time high. We are not sure you realize that.

The situation is even more volatile because Kremlin leaders are not sure who is calling the shots in Washington. This is not the first time that President Putin has encountered such uncertainty (see brief Appendix below). This is, however, the first time that Russian forces have deployed in such numbers into the area, ready to do battle. The stakes are very high.

We hope that John Bolton has given you an accurate description of his acerbic talks with his Russian counterpart in Geneva a few weeks ago. In our view, it is a safe bet that the Kremlin is uncertain whether Bolton faithfully speaks in your stead, or speaks INSTEAD of you.

The best way to assure Mr. Putin that you are in control of U.S. policy toward Syria would be for you to seek an early opportunity to speak out publicly, spelling out your intentions. If you wish wider war, Bolton has put you on the right path.

If you wish to cool things down, you may wish to consider what might be called a pre-emptive ceasefire. By that we mean a public commitment by the Presidents of the U.S. and Russia to strengthen procedures to preclude an open clash between U.S. and Russian armed forces. We believe that, in present circumstances, this kind of extraordinary step is now required to head off wider war.

Sept 17, 2016: U.S. Air Force bombs fixed Syrian Army positions killing between 64 and 84 Syrian army troops; about 100 others wounded — evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.

Sept 26, 2016: We can assume that what Lavrov has told his boss in private is close to his uncharacteristically blunt words on Russian NTV on Sept. 26. (In public remarks bordering on the insubordinate, senior Pentagon officials a few days earlier had showed unusually open skepticism regarding key aspects of the Kerry-Lavrov agreement – like sharing intelligence with the Russians (a key provision of the deal approved by both Obama and Putin). Here’s what Lavrov said on Sept 26:

“My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the US military machine. Despite the fact that, as always, [they] made assurances that the US Commander in Chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin), apparently the military does not really listen to the Commander in Chief.”

Lavrov went beyond mere rhetoric. He also specifically criticized JCS Chairman Joseph Dunford for telling Congress that he opposed sharing intelligence with Russia, “after the agreements concluded on direct orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Barack Obama stipulated that they would share intelligence. … It is difficult to work with such partners. …”

Oct 27, 2016: Putin speaks at the Valdai International Discussion Club

At Valdai Russian President Putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented: “My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.” He complained about “people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.”

Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) is made up of former intelligence officers, diplomats, military officers and congressional staffers. The organization, founded in 2002, was among the first critics of Washington’s justifications for launching a war against Iraq. VIPS advocates a US foreign and national security policy based on genuine national interests rather than contrived threats promoted for largely political reasons. An archive of VIPS memoranda is available at Consortiumnews.com.

21st Century Wire says…

In a new report released on Thursday, President Trump ‘does a 180’ on his previous policy against pursuing regime change in Syria – now agreeing to “a new strategy for an indefinitely extended military, diplomatic and economic effort there, according to senior State Department officials.”



Regime change may be back on the table, but in reality it never left with U.S. illegal and permanent occupation of Syria.

While Trump’s prior positions on regime change may have signaled a shift in regime change aspirations, U.S. military actions on the ground in Syria have always aligned with overthrowing the democratically elected Bashar al-Assad and his administration.

For evidence of this you need look no further than the troop build-up and presence in the southeastern part of Syria, specifically near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders in the area of al-Tanf, where a U.S. military base was established (illegally) in 2016 for the stated purpose of countering ISIS and training Syrian opposition groups in their fight against ISIS. However, these ‘moderate rebels’ are not fighting ISIS, instead they are free to run amok across the country whether under direct supervision of U.S. forces or not.

In al-Tanf, the U.S. military has permanently established a 55KM ‘de-confliction zone’ along a stretch of the Baghdad-Damascus highway within the borders of the sovereign country of Syria. U.S. forces operate with impunity here and have strategically positioned themselves to also monitor and beat back, if needed, Iranian-backed forces – essentially playing the role of occupier, judge, jury and executioner on foreign soil in this region.

And what about ISIS? If you believe all the government and corporate media propaganda, then you probably still think that ISIS is entirely a grassroots Islamic ideological movement – with no connection to foreign agencies like the CIA, Britain’s MI6, Turkish (NATO) intelligence, Saudi intelligence, Israeli intelligence, or Pakistan’s ISI. Not only would you still be wrong, but US coalition support for ISIS is an “open dirty secret” that continues to this day:

Right from the beginning, the conflict in Syria was no civil war, but a US-imposed proxy war. In the process, Washington recruited, trained, armed, guided, protected and transported ISIS militias in a ruthless effort to overthrow the Syrian government. — Doug Bell (@realDougBell) September 6, 2018

SEE ALSO: Top 10 Curious Circumstances That Led to the Rise of ISIS

If you need even further proof of the open-ended and perpetual nature of this occupation in Syria, look no further than today’s reaction by U.S. officials in response to Russia’s warning of pending attack on Syrian militants in the al-Tanf area:

“The United States does not seek to fight the government of Syria or any groups that may be providing it support. However, if attacked, the United States will not hesitate to use necessary and proportionate force to defend US, coalition or partner forces,” a defense official told CNN.

U.S. officials are claiming a ‘right of self-defense’ in Syria as illegal occupiers of the country? This is in direct conflict with sanity and international law.

So for the last time I will make an appeal to sanity and international law: this is exactly why the US must end its illegal occupation of Northeastern #Syria. US position is a CASUS BELLI. Pure and simple. Any questions? https://t.co/itXZ1bOjjm — Patrick Henningsen (@21WIRE) September 7, 2018

Vanessa Beeley

21st Century Wire

According to reports in CBS News, a number of members of the pro-Syrian-regime-change coalition, including the UK and Holland have lobbied U.S President, Donald Trump, to evacuate the White Helmets from Syria to avoid their possible elimination in the battles to liberate the Southern provinces of Syria that are occupied by Nusra Front who power multiply the ubiquitous armed “moderates” favoured by the US Coalition.

“CBS News has learned the question of how to extract the emergency workers was raised with President Trump in multiple conversations with allied countries on the sidelines of the NATO summit. The Netherlands, U.K., France, Canada and Germany are scrambling to find a way to save the lives of an estimated 1,000 volunteers and their family members. Around 300 of them are considered to be in imminent danger.”

The UK are primary creators and fundraisers for the Al Qaeda (and splinter groups) auxiliary and Theresa May was quick to leap to their defence:

“Prime Minister Theresa May personally brought up the emergency issue during her meeting with Mr. Trump in the U.K. Formally known as the Syrian Civil Defense group, the White Helmets expect to be marked as resistance targets and slaughtered by Assad’s forces, which are backed by Iranian and Russian firepower.”

This is not the first time that the White Helmets have been given such high level protection by the members of the “International Community” who have been waging an illegal war against Syria for more than seven years. On the 16th March 2018, the permanent Syrian representative at the UN, Dr Bashar Al Jaafari informed the UN Security Council:

“He warned that giving the opportunity for terrorist groups, including the so-called “White Helmets” which are affiliated to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, to use the Security Council as a podium constitutes a flagrant violation of UNSC resolutions, particularly those related to combating terrorism, adding “the biggest scandal is that a UN agency operating in Damascus demanded the evacuation of 76 members of White Helmets from Eastern Ghouta, while paying no attention to the lives of thousands of civilians.”

On the 17th March, NATO-aligned, Soros funded NGO – Human Rights Watch reported:

“On March 17, Human Rights Watch received a distress call from a member of the Syrian Civil Defense who told Human Rights Watch that he and 19 colleagues, five of whom are wounded, have been surrounded by government forces. According to him, in addition, there are 90 members of the Syrian Civil Defense and their relatives trapped in a second location, and they are all requesting safe passage to non-government-held areas. He said they fear retaliation, including summary execution, when the government takes the area.”

It appears that NATO member states have brought pressure to bear upon Trump prior to his meeting with Putin next week in the hope that Trump can persuade Putin to spare the lives of their most valuable asset, the White Helmets – who have been single-handedly responsible for producing and nurturing the majority of chemical/chlorine weapon attack narratives, including Khan Sheikhoun and Douma that has now been proven highly contentious by the OPCW interim report.

21st Century Wire article: False Flag Fail: How Syrian Civilians Derailed White Helmet Chemical Stunt in Eastern Ghouta

The alarmist reports from the financiers of the White Helmets among NATO member states, include claims that the Syrian government will execute the members of this terrorist aligned group when liberation of the southern region is completed. These claims ignore the fact that, in East Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta, the White Helmets fled alongside the armed groups on the green buses that evacuated them to Idlib.

“This effort says we are in the evacuation phase. It is an admission that the regime is going to regain control of the country and the White Helmets can’t remain,” said a U.S. government official.” ~ from CBS report.

Trump has signalled the withdrawl of US presence inside Syria and an end to the illegal US occupation of the North East of Syria. The requested removal of the White Helmets is another admission of this group being a member of the regime-change-coalition apparatus as had been previously stated by US State Department spokesperson, Heather Nauert in an extraordinary press briefing:

…

As with East Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta liberations from extremist armed group occupation – these NATO member states and their lock-step media will not mention the scenes of celebration that are emerging from Daraa and the surrounding countryside following full liberation by the Syrian Arab Army and allies, including the Russian Amnesty and Reconciliation teams who will have negotiated the evacuations of the armed groups and their sidekicks, the White Helmets:

No further proof is needed that the White Helmets are an integral part of the US Coalition regime change machinery and that deals have been struck to protect this primary propaganda construct that has consistently advocated “no fly zones” and called upon the international community to intervene militarily on behalf of the faux-revolutionary forces that have brutalised the Syrian people for more than seven years. Perhaps Trump genuinely intends to withdraw all assets from inside Syria – if that is the case where will the White Helmets go? Will they morph into a “security force” to “rebuild Syria” as has been suggested in a number of reports?

White Helmets Exit strategy – resettlement into Europe https://t.co/YCIpjHw1Z5 — Friedemann Wo (@FriedemannWo) July 15, 2018

The White Helmets do not stay to help the civilians, while claiming to have rescued 115,000 since their establishment in Turkey and Jordan in 2013. They move with the armed groups with no regard for the civilian population they leave behind.

Much is made of the alleged Russian “propaganda campaign” to discredit this UK/US hybrid-war group of narrative builders but very little has been said about an informed Syrian population who understand the part played by this group in maintaining the war and the suffering of millions inside and outside Syria. It is Syria that will reject the White Helmets and it is Syrians who should be heard when they accuse this pseudo first response outfit of war crimes and child abduction, among a number of other atrocities they are accused of having committed or enabled:

“Civil defence” (White Helmets) were supposed to help wounded civilians, but NO! if any of the terrorists were wounded they would run to their aid, but civilians – NO. It was very rare, if they (White Helmets) weren’t going to film it, they wouldn’t come.

When the camera was there they would run around as if they were helping people.

Our neighbor in Zamalka – we left on Friday, but on the Previous Wednesday, there were strikes. The ceiling collapsed onto the woman, and her children. We – the women – pulled 3 kids from under the wreckage, they were alive, but the mother remained there, from the morning till the evening. Nobody came to help. We witnessed that. Her husband kept running around asking them for help, they said “NO”.

They (White Helmets) blamed us for leaving the basement. We were dying in these basements. The smell, alone, could kill you. We were sitting on the floor, nothing there, not even toilets, we needed water, they had given us water tanks with taps, but when the taps were broken, they didn’t fix them. We had to go far away to find water.

When the woman was trapped under the ceiling, they (White Helmets) didn’t come to help her. She stayed there till it was a bit before dusk when groups of people came and got her out…in pieces.” ~ Sabah Al Mushref.

…

UPDATE 16.7.2018: A recent CNN report on the predicament of the White Helmets claims that diplomatic sources have told them that the U.K, Germany and Canada will be the countries to receive refugee White Helmets. This is worrying blowback as these terrorist affiliates will be absorbed into the societies whose governments created them and sustained them. Will they be redirected? Will they be utilised to further discredit and vilify the Syrian government, SAA and allies? Will they be expected to train new teams of interventionist instruments for future campaigns? Will our Fire Services be expected to employ them, despite cut backs and austerity measures imposed by this Tory government?

Too many questions and too many consequences of the UK FCO financing of yet another regime change war that has failed and is now coming home to roost.

Nepotism and corruption are nothing new, particularly in the corporate or political sphere. In 2013 Boris Johnson’s brother Jo was appointed head of No 10’s policy unit under David Cameron. As the Guardian article noted, this appointment did not appear to be a crucial necessity: “it’s not as if anyone had complained of a dire shortage of Johnsons in the public eye, or of Old Etonians in the cabinet.”

Cameron and Johnson are both “Old Etonians” and shared the notoriety of being members of the elite Bullingdon Club at Oxford, whose members were renonwned for ostentatious displays of wealth, raucous, hard-drinking dinners and the exclusion of women from their ranks.

I am not going to dwell upon the vagaries of such clubs and networks that united the establishment elite into an exclusive consortium of wealth and privilege that has served them well throughout their careers and countless falls from grace.

However, now the White Helmets are involved believe it or not in a way that fully exposes the nepotism and corruption at the highest levels of policy making and intervention into the affairs of a sovereign nation, in this case, Syria.

Mayday Rescue

Mayday Rescue is the allegedly Netherlands based NGO funded by a number of the governments that have a very transparent objective of regime change in Syria. Mayday Rescue was established by James Le Mesurier, a British ex-Sandhurst private security “expert”, who had previously set up the White Helmets in Turkey and Jordan while employed by the ARK Group DMCC.

Both ARK Group and Mayday Rescue are funded by the UK FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) Conflict Stability and Security Fund that coincidentally was created in 2015 and allowed Mayday Rescue to take over the financing of the White Helmets, providing valuable plausible deniability for the government of “Global Britain” – the term coined by Theresa May and echoed by Boris Johnson. Prior to the creation of the CSSF, it appears that the ARK Group’s establishment of the White Helmets was funded by CSSF’s predecessor, the Syria Conflict Pool.

The CEO of ARK, Alistair Harris, also works in collaboration with the UK’s National Security complex. He is also CEO of The Stabilisation Network DMCC, based in Dubai, which is listed as one of the CSSF approved contractors. Both Harris and Le Mesurier have been awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) – Harris for services in Lebanon. Le Mesurier was rewarded for “services to Syria Civil Defence and the protection of civilians in Syria“.

Both men, therefore, have close ties to the UK National Security apparatus and an expertise in implementing security solutions, working in private sector military circles and imposing “stabilisation” projects upon UK FCO designated nations, including Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Afghanistan, Lebanon and in the case of Le Mesurier, Kosovo. Both men work out of Dubai. The initial register of Mayday Rescue was in Dubai before it was relocated to the more neutral Netherlands and Le Mesurier works for Bush’s ex-terror advisor, the Terror Czar himself, Richard A. Clark, at Good Harbour International in Dubai.

The links between these players in the Global Britain subcontracter market are clearly defined.

The Eton Mess



Andrew Gilmour with Ban Ki-Moon (UN Press)

In October 2016 a young man left Oxford University and walked straight into a position as Operations manager at Mayday Rescue. His name is Archie Gilmour. He is the son of Andrew Gilmour – “United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today announced the appointment of Andrew Gilmour of the United Kingdom as Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Head of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in New York.”

According to the UN Press release:

“Since joining the United Nations in 1989, he has held a variety of positions at United Nations Headquarters and in the field, including in Afghanistan-Pakistan, Kosovo, State of Palestine and West Africa. In recent years, he has served as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq, and later, in South Sudan. Prior to his current position, he was the Representative of the Secretary-General in Belgrade.”

Perhaps more importantly, Gilmour was at Eton College with Boris Johnson and then they were reunited at Balliol College, Oxford:

“Johnson arrived at Eton as a scholar in the autumn of 1977, aged 13. He was part of the school’s intellectual elite, accommodated in a separate house and marked out by being made to wear gowns. By the time he left, at the end of 1982, he had become a commanding figure with a reputation as a star performer. His speciality was forgetting his lines. One of his friends, Andrew Gilmour, remembers Johnson reciting the first page of Evelyn Waugh’s Decline and Fall, which begins: “Mr Sniggs, the Junior Dean, and Mr Postlethwaite, the Domestic Bursar . . .” ~ Daily Mail

Johnson’s return to Balliol in May 2017 was not the victorious homecomeing to his alma mater that he may have wished for:

Boris wanted a quiet visit to his old college for lunch today. Students found out and had other ideas. pic.twitter.com/2gCtglTyXW — Novara Media (@novaramedia) May 28, 2017

Archie Gilmour of Mayday Rescue is also Boris Johnson’s Godson. The nepotism circle is closed.

Why Should this Matter?

It should matter very much. Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson is responsible for the continued presence of Global Britain’s troops in Syria on the extraordinary pretext of “defending Iraq from ISIS” – based upon Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon’s reply to Baroness Cox on 22nd February 2018:

Johnson has publicly heaped praise upon the White Helmets despite the growing mountain of evidence that they are embedded with a number of terrorist (Al Qaeda) and extremist factions inside Syria and are responsible for producing the bulk of the propaganda that serves to criminalise the Syrian government and its allies. Johnson has increased funding to this sectarian group of British produced and trained pseudo-“humanitarians” and the UK FCO has recently admitted to financing the White Helmets almost £ 39m since their creation in 2013.

…

The Foreign Secretary of Global Britain, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Head of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in New York and an Operations Manager at the White Helmet-financing Mayday Rescue are intrinsically linked, when viewed through the elite network prism that has secured jobs for the boys for centuries. Old Etonians and Oxford graduates united behind an organisation destined to be an integral part of the Syria whose future does not include the elected President, Bashar Al Assad, according to these Global Britain acolytes.

Where will complaints from the Syrian people against the White Helmets go within the UN? They will be swept into the memory hole that will secure Archie’s future in the Global Britain security and stabilisation industry. No dissent against the White Helmets will be tolerated by the Eton guild. Corruption at this level should not surprise us, nepotism should not come as a shock but the benefits reaped by the initiated come at the expense of innocent people whose blood is being shed while the champagne glasses clink over another appointment made by the privileged for the privileged.

Archie Gilmour is very unlikely to question the hidden agenda of the White Helmets, he would prefer not to derail his own career path in favour of truth, not when his Godfather and father are a part of the apparatus that requires the image of the White Helmets to remain untarnished and credible, both in Syria and in future destabilization zones where Archie will deploy his rebranded stabilization teams to repair the damage brought about by Global Britain’s colonialist zeal.

This is a simple story, a revealing one, and one that goes to the heart of the corrosion of our society in the West. Our institutions, including the UN, are owned and controlled by those who will exploit their founding principles for their own gains, not for the “humantarian” principles they claim to uphold. These plutocrats are violently inflicting a faux “democracy” upon nations who courageously defend their right to decide their own future according to the “international” laws put in place by those who now violate them at will because they know the establishment has their back.

On the other hand:

“On the 6th of March, in Hamouriya, we decided to protest against Failaq Al Rahman and we raised the Syrian flag. We marched against the terrorist occupation. They (Failaq Al Rahman) and the White Helmets were preparing a chemical attack which they intended to blame on the Syrian Arab Army as they closed in on the militants. They were furious with us for our march and for raising the Syrian flag, because it ruined their plans” ~ Ibrahim Omar Toumeh, resident of Hamouriya, 45 years old.

Some weeks after the liberation of Eastern Ghouta which had been occupied by a series of militant and extremist groups backed and armed by a variety of NATO-member-states, Gulf States and protected by Israel, I had the opportunity to interview civilians from all districts, both on the ground in Ghouta and in the nearby IDP (Internally Displaced People) camps that consisted of highly organised education centres for children, clean single-floor buildings that housed extended families, and that provided clean water, electricity, food and essential supplies to the thousands of temporary residents.

I met Ibrahim Omar Toumeh in Harjalleh camp. He had arrived from Hamouriya one week previously, with his entire family. He and his family were keen to talk about their experiences living under Failaq Al Rahman rule (Al Qaeda affiliate) in their neighborhood. The usual stories of deprivation, imprisonment, sectarian brutality were recounted. I was told that the White Helmets worked as “one hand” with the terrorist factions throughout Eastern Ghouta:

“White Helmets worked everywhere, they had points in all places – Harasta, Douma, Misrata, Otaya and they had centres in other sectors also alongside Failaq Al Rahman brigade (Nusra Front affiliate). They had points in Jobar also. Everywhere in Ghouta. They worked with terrorist groups like Jaish Al Islam, Failaq Al Rahman, Fair Al-Ummah (Dawn of the Nations).”

~ Mahmoud Al Khaled, resident of Hamouriya.

Toumeh described what he believed happened in Hamouriya on the 6th March 2018 and the days leading up to that date. He told me that at this time, the Syrian Arab Army were rapidly advancing towards Hamouriya and civilians were beginning to feel empowered and more able to protest the presence of Failaq Al Rahman and their associates, the White Helmets and other militant groups.

“On the 6th of March a major conference was due to be held in the UN. We always knew about these conferences because of the co-ordinators in Hamouriya that worked with people inside the UN. On the 4th and 5th of March, the White Helmets and the armed groups began to gather bodies in the hospital. They brought these bodies from everywhere, and they brought them to the place where they would stage an attack. By the 5th, they had around 30 bodies in the hospital and the White Helmets started to take photographs.”

~ Ibrahim Toumeh

Watch this video of Hamouriya residents raising the Syrian flag on 6th March 2018:

…

Toumeh continued:

“On the 6th March, we knew the Syrian Arab Army was getting closer. A group of us decided to march in the streets of Hamouriya and to raise the Syrian flag in solidarity with the Army. We knew the armed groups (Failaq Al Rahman) were betting on a western military intervention with reinforcements from the U.S base at Al Tanf. The armed groups told us that there were even ISIS terrorists from Deir Ezzor among these groups in Al Tanf.”

[EDIT: Investigative journalist, Elijah Magnier, had written about the US secret plans to divert militants from Al Tanf camp to reinforce the extremist groups in control of Eastern Ghouta, in his article: The US Secret Plan on Damascus Foiled – The Russian Role Before the US/UK/France Attack Revealed]

When I checked the 6th March in the UN calendar there had, indeed, been a high level discussion on Syria. “The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, attended a meeting today with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Turkey, hosted by the Russian Federation at its permanent mission in Geneva.”

Toumeh then told me:

“The armed groups were always telling us that the West would intervene and help them to conquer Damascus. After six years of their lies, we knew it was not going to happen. We were human shields for them, nothing more. We were fed up with their lies, so we raised the Syrian flag and we marched to tell them (Failaq Al Rahman) to leave Hamouriya.

About an hour after we raised the flag, one of the head co-ordinators came to us with another person and he told us that we had ruined their plans. I asked why. They told me they had released “news” of a chemical attack the night before, saying 30 people had been killed. When we raised the flag around 3pm or 3.30pm the day after, we ruined it for them”

I asked Toumeh why he thought they said it was ruined, he smiled and then replied:

“They told me – ‘how can an area get hit by chemical weapons by the Syrian government and then hours later residents in the same area, are raising the Syrian flag?’. They also told me we had ruined their communications with the UN and that there would be no intervention from Al Tanf after all. The main co-ordinator’s name was Abdulmueeh Hommus.

They wanted to present the “chemical attack” on the day the SAA entered Hamouriya, you see? The next day Failaq Al Rahman issued a Fatwa against all of us. All of us were sentenced to death. They brought one of their prisoners, they wrapped him in the Syrian flag and they shot him dead with three bullets to threaten us. We didnt care. We co-ordinated with the Army and they helped us to leave Hamouriya.”

The following video shows some of the Failaq Al Rahman reprisals against the civilian protestors in Hamouriya. WATCH:

…

Many reports on the SAA military campaign centering on Hamouriya confirm that the final liberation of this town was imminent. According to SouthFront’s war report on March 7th:

On March 6, the White Helments, a notorious organization operating in areas controlled by al-Qaeda-linked militants, reported that government forces had conducted a new chlorine gas attack in Eastern Ghouta allegedly injuring 30 people. It’s interesting to note that reports about alleged chemical attacks started appearing during a rapid advance by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and its allies against Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda), Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman.

By March 7, SAA troops had liberated a large area, including farms near the towns of Misraba and Beit Sawa. The town of Hammouriyah had reportedly surrendered to the SAA and government troops had started entering it.” (Emphasis added)

The White Helmet twitter feed confirms their claim of a chlorine gas attack in Hamouriya on the 6th March:

Following a Regime #chlorine gas attack in #Hamorieh city, more than 30 suffocation cases including women, children, #CivilDefense volunteers, only hours after the Aid convoy arrived and left #EasternGhouta . This is attack number 8 in 2018 pic.twitter.com/IlbByRMP2d — The White Helmets (@SyriaCivilDef) March 5, 2018

Toumeh is not the only one to have spoken to me about this staged chemical attack.

32 year old Mohammed Al Khatib is also from Hamouriya. I interviewed him in April 2018. He told me:

“The chemical attack was going to be staged to the East of the town in the direction of the Syrian Arab Army. The day before, the White Helmets started to bring bodies to the area, to the hospital. The media groups working with the armed groups also came. They started to film and photograph the bodies. There were many children among the dead. At this time all the medical centres were out of service. Only the White Helmets were bringing bodies from all over Hamouriya to this one centre so it would look as if they had been killed in this attack. On the 6th March after we had marched and raised the flag, we were approached by some of the White Helmet members. They were very angry with us. They told us they wanted to force the West to intervene on their behalf but now their plan would not work and it was our fault. This was the first time we saw them actually preparing a movie against our country. Usually they would make us go into the basement until they had finished filming an event.”

Mohammed a father and grandfather from Hamouriya was among those severely punished by Failaq Al Rahman for raising the Syrian flag on the 6th March 2018. I have already told his harrowing story in a previous article:

SEE ALSO: Voices From Eastern Ghouta, Video Testimonies.

The Main Players

When I first heard these testimonies which were echoed by a number of other witnesses from Hamouriya but not in so much detail, I began to piece together the events of the 6th March 2018 and found that much of what had been described to me fell into place alongside tweets and reports from the various Western backed organisations on the ground in Eastern Ghouta.

Those organisations were headed up by the U.S Coalition multi-million-dollar financed White Helmets, with a history of being the preferred source for evidence of previous alleged chemical weapon attacks, including Khan Sheikhoun one year ago in April 2017.

The reliance on the White Helmets to provide the narratives to corroborate UK and U.S government policy in Syria has been undeniably demonstrated by a UK FCO document outlining funding for the White Helmets via the Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF).

SEE ALSO: White Helmets: ‘Humanitarians’ and the ‘Moderate’ Bomb Factory in Saqba, Eastern Ghouta.

Toumeh had told me the demonstrations and flag raising took place around 3pm in the afternoon. The first announcements of an SAA chlorine attack in Hamouriya began to appear from late on the night of the 5th of March (depending on time zone) and then during the day of the 6th March as seen in the White Helmet tweet I have included in the article.

The media and advocacy manager for the White Helmets, Asaad Hanna, was among the first to signal the alleged chlorine attack in Hamouriya. It is worth bearing in mind that according to his own CV, Hanna also is a contributor at Chatham House the British Government-linked policy institute, The Washington Times and TRT World, Turkish state media.

Hanna is a researcher at the Washington-based Toran Centre, where Professor Scott Lucas of EA Worldview is also a consultant. Dima Moussa is also a researcher at the Toran centre – and Moussa is the newly elected Vice-President of the Syrian National Coalition Of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces (formerly known as the SNC, the US-created ‘opposition government’ in exile) and had previously worked for ARK Group and Mayday Rescue, according to her LinkedIn page.

The founder of the White Helmets, James Le Mesurier worked for ARK Group when he established the White Helmets in Turkey, Moussa was with ARK during this period. Le Mesurier then went on to set up Mayday Rescue, ostensibly in the Netherlands (Wayback machine shows the Mayday address in Dubai) as an intermediary to receive and transfer funds from the UK FCO CSSF to the White Helmets. During her time as Operations Manager at Mayday Rescue, Moussa was clearly involved in the day to day support for the White Helmets.

I will go into greater depth about these connections in a subsequent article but this information demonstrates how closely knit these organisations are and how they form a network that is capable of promulgating Syrian narratives favourable to the US Coalition interventionist road map – rapidly and across a diverse and extensive information base that includes corporate media, think tanks and government-aligned institutions, thus ensuring their influence over policy decisions by governments such as the UK and U.S, already heavily invested in the “regime change” operation in Syria.

The Ayman Asfari -funded “Violations Documentation Centre” (VDC) put out a ‘witness’ statement on Twitter on the 6th March:

Ayman Asfari also provided seed funding and ongoing support for Syria Campaign who effectively run the publicity campaign for the White Helmets and has succeeded in presenting these Al Qaeda (and associated extremist groups) affiliates as “impartial, unarmed and neutral humanitarians” for five years since their creation in March 2013, in Turkey.

VDC had previously used one of the more notorious White Helmets as an “expert” witness for another alleged chemical weapon attack in Sarmin, Idlib in March 2015. Muawiya Agha Hassan is perhaps best known for his criminal participation in the torture and execution of two SAA prisoners of war in Khan Touman, Aleppo in April 2016.

In the early hours of the morning of the 7th March Dr Zaher Sahloul of SAMS (Syrian American Medical Society) tweeted the statement from the so-called Syrian Interim Government retracting claims of a “chlorine attack” which ties in with the statements from Toumeh and Khatib – that their march and protests had derailed plans by the White Helmets and Failaq Al Rahman – to stage a chlorine attack event:

It looks that the reported “#Chlorine” attack in Ghouta yesterday was due to exposure to irritating fumes from high potency explosives after all pic.twitter.com/h0NeFPZhrq — Dr. Zaher Sahloul (@sahloul) March 6, 2018

The VDC tweet had been picked up by Syrian “armed opposition” and White Helmet supporter, Professor Scott Lucas of EA Worldview (consultant at the Toran Centre) in an article published the same day, the 6th March. The information was only updated in a separate report on the 7th March when Lucas confirmed that a chemical attack had not actually taken place in Hamouriya on the 6th March:

“As the residents of Hamouriya surrendered, the opposition’s Health Directorate said a Monday “gas attack” was actually fumes from high-potency explosives.”

When I challenged Lucas on why he had not corrected the first article rather than burying the retraction in a ‘follow-up’ article, he responded with familiar defensive avoidance tactics:

Now your turn: please address questions you avoided on Wed. 1. Name #Assad regime officials who enabled your ""journalism"" in #Syria 2. Provide any evidence for yr falsehood ""kidnapped children by #WhiteHelmets"" in #EastGhouta#Syria #FunWithAssadTrolls — Scott Lucas (@ScottLucas_EA) June 28, 2018

Joyce Karam of The National was another one to run with the story literally as it appeared on the Twitter pages of the moderate extremist support groups and individuals, such as Mohamad Katoub, advocacy manager for SAMS – based in… Gaziantep, Turkey:

6 children, 4 women, and 2 men were reported to be contaminated by a #chlorine attack in Hamorieh in #Ghouta tonight. All victims arrived with moderate symptoms, and no fatality was reported. This is attack number 8 in 2018 and 198 since 2012 — Mohamad Katoub (@MhdKatoub) March 5, 2018

The National alludes to the threat of U.S. intervention if ‘another chemical attack’ is perceived to have been carried out by the SAA:

If the attack is proven, it comes at a tricky time for the debate in Washington. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that “the Trump administration has considered new military action against the Syrian government in response to reports of ongoing chemical weapons use.” (Emphasis added)

Al Araby UK also ran the story based upon the White Helmet accounts and has not retracted it to my knowledge, the article is still available on their website and has not been updated.

France Threatens Intervention

Bearing in mind Toumeh’s claims that these “chlorine attacks” were staged in an attempt by Failaq Al Rahman and the White Helmets to pressure the West to intervene on their behalf, it was not surprising to see that France was posturing wildly as Eastern Ghouta was being liberated and the Western proxy grip on Damascus was finally being prised apart.

On the 8th March:

“If the use of chemical weapons were found, verified, attributed and the use of the chemical weapon left people dead,” France would take “intervention measures to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons,”

– Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Foreign Minister.

On the 12th March:

“The day we have, in particular in tandem with our American partners, irrefutable proof that the red line was crossed — namely the chemical weapons were used to lethal effect — we will do what the Americans themselves did moreover a few months ago; we would put ourselves in position to proceed with targeted strikes,”

– French President, Francois Macron.

The race was on to fulfill this prophecy. Nothing could have given greater encouragement for the US Coalition assets on the ground in Syria to produce a chemical attack provocation than such bellicose rhetoric from Macron and Trump.

Immediately after the retraction of the 6th March chlorine attack, another chlorine attack was allegedly carried out in Hamouriya on the 7th March which was picked up by The Guardian – Kareem Shaheen in Istanbul, to be precise – based upon testimony from the “rescue workers” which we must presume to be the White Helmets although they are not named by Shaheen.

“They said 29 people, including 15 children, were admitted to a medical centre with breathing problems after a suspected toxic gas attack on the towns of Hamoryah and Saqba.” (Emphasis added)

A familiar White Helmet figure provided a dramatic statement for Al Jazeera.

“Yesterday night was the darkest and most horrific night ever. They used phosphorus, napalm, cluster bombs and chlorine gas,” Ammar al-Selmo, a volunteer aid worker for the Syrian Civil Defence, told Al Jazeera by phone from the opposition-held enclave.”

In September 2016, Al-Selmo provided ‘evidence’ of the alleged Russian bombing of a humanitarian convoy west of Aleppo City. Investigative journalist, Gareth Porter, masterfully deconstructed this evidence in a later report.

The following video was produced by @Syricide on Twitter based upon Al Selmo’s statements in September 2016. There is a remarkable similarity in sensationalism between the 2016 and 2017 statements. WATCH:

…

Conclusions

Media outlets in the West have no issue with a rush to judgement regarding “suspected” chemical attacks when the source is a part of the approved team on the ground in Syria, dominated by the White Helmets. The stream of chemical weapon reports are repeated in a manner that barely raises any doubt over their credibility. Questions are not asked, and even when the narrative is then retracted, an attack one day later is reported without the caveat that victim symptoms may be the result of smoke inhalation, rather than chlorine or other toxic gas.

The treadmill of “chemical attacks” must be maintained because that is what will instigate U.S coalition intervention, according to the U.S Coalition. Journalists should be mapping the correlation between SAA military advances, the uptick in U.S allied belligerence towards Syria and the increase in claims of chemical attacks by the extremist groups benefiting from U.S intervention. Of course this is not what happens. The western media journalists literally copy-paste the White Helmets supplied narrative that enables an escalation in military aggression in support of the sectarian, extremist occupiers of civilian areas in Syria.

To what degree does the tail wag the dog? Are the U.K, U.S. and France genuinely in control of the White Helmet narratives, do they communicate with co-ordinators on the ground when they feel it is most convenient to receive news of a chemical attack? Or, do the White Helmets take control at times when they feel threatened, in order to trigger international reactions?

The importance given to the protection of the White Helmets by UN agencies, was condemned by Dr Bashar Al Jaafari, Syrian permanent representative to the UN, on the 16th March.

“He warned that giving the opportunity for terrorist groups, including the so-called “White Helmets” which are affiliated to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, to use the Security Council as a podium constitutes a flagrant violation of UNSC resolutions, particularly those related to combating terrorism, adding “the biggest scandal is that a UN agency operating in Damascus demanded the evacuation of 76 members of White Helmets from Eastern Ghouta, while paying no attention to the lives of thousands of civilians.”

HRW (Human Rights Watch) who, by their own admission, rely heavily upon the White Helmets for their evidence in Syria, reported on March 17th that they had received a distress call from the White Helmets claiming a number of them were surrounded by the SAA and were fearing “summary execution”.

White Helmets had issued similar reports during the final hours of the liberation of East Aleppo. Owen Jones of The Guardian repeated those stories without hesitation at the time. I was on the ground in Aleppo during liberation and again in Eastern Ghouta. Any White Helmets or armed factions who took Amnesty, were evacuated safely with their families to Idlib.

The April 7th Douma alleged chemical attack was also dismissed as a non-chemical bombing by medical staff who treated victims in the Douma Medical Point. This was reported by Robert Fisk and by a number of other journalists, independent and mainstream who visited the site, including myself.

Despite the clear possibility of this being another misreported “chemical attack”, the corporate media seemed to suffer from selective amnesia in their usual rush to judgement that provided cover for the U.S, U.K and France to unlawfully bomb Syria on the 14th April. This amnesia also covers the existence of chemical weapon manufacturing facilities under the control of the extremist groups across Eastern Ghouta, including Jaish Al Islam in Douma.

…

When we take into consideration the uniformity of narrative across the inter-connecting groups and support groups, including western media, it is hard not to conclude that truth is indeed the first casualty of war, brought to it’s knees by a narrative building apparatus that is ultimately financed and constructed by the hostile government agencies that benefit most from a contrived account of events on the ground in Syria.

The #UK Decision at the @OPCW Conference of State Parties has passed with votes 82 in favour (24 No). The international community has come together to strengthen the ban against chemical weapons use. #CSPSS4 #NoToChemicalWeapons pic.twitter.com/9vtGthXzWx — UK Delegation OPCW (@UK_OPCW) June 27, 2018

The new powers granted to the OPCW to attribute blame will surely lead to a further increase in “chemical attack” claims from the White Helmets and associated militant and terrorist groups still occupying rapidly dwindling areas of southern Syria and in Idlib which will soon be the focus of the SAA campaign to cleanse Syria of the foreign invaders.

21st Century Wire says…

Can you believe this train wreck of ‘legislative oversight,’ tweets, likes and emojis? Are taxpayers actually funding this elaborate, neverending charade?



Make up your own caption: ‘Yes Senator, I wore my best beard and nose ring today.’

It’s not enough that these social media giants have prostrated themselves and become willing dongles to the government. Now, their milktoast executive leaders must fly to Washington and sit through a monotonous receiving line of questions from fanboy and fangirl politicians looking to get social media mentions in the ‘fight against Russia.’ Incredible.

Tom ‘Tough Guy’ Cotton

It’s embarrassing and shameful to watch U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) grandstand like a first class fascist, as he attempts to ‘lean in’ on Facebook and Twitter and openly advocate for censorship, and the closure of Wikileaks.

In response to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s weak lament about ’24/7 global surveillance’, NeoHawk Cotton had this to say:

“Is Twitter an American company? … Do you prefer to see America remain the world’s dominant global superpower?”

What on earth are you talking about senator? This isn’t a reboot of the ‘red scare’ 1950s. Or is it? And about that Google thing: Tom, don’t worry, they’re still onside:



Auctioneering? Or, Auctioning Free Speech?

In something that could only be fit for a screwball comedy, U.S. Congressman Billy Long (R-MO) is heard mimicking an auctioneer in an attempt to drown out the heckling voice of political activist Laura Loomer. If you just landed on this planet, you might think the government was auctioning off free speech to the highest bidder at that exact moment.

Loomer can be heard shouting at Dorsey for censoring and shadow banning conservatives on his platform:



Rubbernecking: ‘Clown’ vs ‘Little Frat Boy’

One of the most entertaining and awkward moments happened in the hallways of the Capitol during the hearing, as Alex Jones of Infowars interview-crashed Marco Rubio’s press conference. The ineffectual Republican senator from Florida told Jones “I don’t know who you are” and the bombastic bullhorner later retorted calling Rubio “a little gangster thug.”

Update: Just 24 hours after Jones attended the hearing as a front row spectator and live streamed throughout the day, Twitter announced this afternoon it was permanently banning him and Infowars from its platform.

We chose this clip, created by RT, because of its high production value for your viewing pleasure:

Other lowlights: Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), an avid Russiagater, who’s no stranger to collusion, made it a point to show an empty seat with Google’s name on it and make a public example out of the search giant. Meanwhile, Senator Angus King (I-ME) suggested to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg that the social media giant should seriously consider a ‘banner or star’ rating to warn people of content they won’t like.

You can watch the full hearing from Wednesday, and join the collective facepalm.

So here’s to the grandstanders – the ones we elect and pay to represent us – they would rather play schoolyard politics and gain popularity than defend liberty. Absolutely and utterly pathetic.

It’s becoming all too clear where the global censorship effort is headed. With tech giants now a willing dongle to government, the infrastructure is in place to decide what is ‘foreign interference’ and who will be taken down next. Now, a legal framework to scale it out to the masses is being planned.

As seen earlier today in The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and the United States, also known as the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence partners, want more access and authority to target Internet users that “sow discord, manipulate public discourse, bias the development of policy, or disrupt markets.” The article continues:

“Foreign interference threatens a nation’s sovereignty, values and national interests — it can limit or shape the polity’s ability to make independent judgements, erode public confidence in our political and government institutions, and interfere with private-sector decision making,” a joint communiqué read. “While senior digital industry representatives did not accept our invitation to participate in discussions on pressing issues regarding the illicit use of online spaces, we reiterated the need for digital industry to take more responsibility for content promulgated and communicated through their platforms and applications.” The communiqué also asserted an “urgent need for law enforcement to gain targeted access to data” subject to legal safeguards and for providers to voluntarily assist with investigations.

During the Gold Coast meeting, the group also referenced ‘hostile nations’ in the context of online platforms – a term that gets tossed around endlessly but nobody really knows what it’s supposed to represent. To this day, there has been no hard evidence presented to the public, for example, proving the Russian government colluded or interfered in the 2016 US Presidential Election.

We’ve even witnessed 21WIRE and many of our colleagues in alternative and independent media labeled ridiculously as ‘agents of the Kremlin’ for simply reporting the truth and informing the public of the news and information not being covering in the mainstream corporate-owned media.

Given that many of us are citizens of the ‘Five Eyes’ countries, are we to be considered foreign hostile actors interfering with domestic politics?

It’s time to reclaim the conversation and expose this for what it is: digital tyranny.

According to witnesses who were present at the meeting – a private conversation with Australian news publishers and broadcasters, Facebook’s head of news partnerships told the group that if they do not work with Facebook that their businesses would die.

The comment is totally at odds with the effect that Facebook claims to have on journalism. At the meeting, the Facebook executive in question had been speaking about “revitalizing journalism”, and later stated that “our goal at Facebook — what the team works on every day with publishers and reporters around the world — is to help journalism succeed and thrive, both on our platform and off.”

A senior Facebook executive has privately admitted Mark Zuckerberg “doesn’t care” about publishers and warned that if they did not work with the social media giant, 'I’ll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a ­hospice' https://t.co/DBVW7aFPhb — The Australian (@australian) August 12, 2018

Although Facebook has demonstrated a pattern of removing or blocking content from its website, the news last week that Alex Jones’ InfoWars media outlet had been removed from a number of social media platforms (including Facebook) has caused renewed interest in the topic of internet censorship. It has also highlighted the market dominance of Facebook, Google and YouTube, which collectively with the mainstream media, now control a dangerous proportion of the information consumers are accessing.

It is noteworthy that Australia’s competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is currently investigating whether Facebook and Google “have disrupted the news media market to the detriment of publishers and consumers.”

The news that Facebook is telling news publishers that they will die should they decide not to work with the platform is not only shocking — it reeks of being a bona fide threat. The only thing missing from these reports is a line from The Godfather; after all, this sounds like an offer these publishers can’t refuse, or they might find themselves sleeping with the fishes.

It is even more shocking when we consider the source. There is no small degree of irony in the fact that the Facebook executive who made the comments, Campbell Brown, had previously been a TV news reporter and anchor. Ms Brown, who built her career at NBC News before moving to CNN, won an Emmy for her coverage of Hurricane Katrina and anchored shows on both networks. As a former successful and high-profile journalist, she might be expected to understand the concept and the value of a free press. Would that be too much to ask?

During a closed-door and off-the-record meeting last week, top Facebook executive Campbell Brown reportedly warned news publishers that refusal to cooperate with the tech behemoth’s efforts to “revitalize journalism” will leave media outlets dying “like in a hospice.”

Reported first by The Australian under a headline which read “Work With Facebook or Die: Zuckerberg,” the social media giant has insisted the comments were taken out of context, even as five individuals who attended the four-hour meeting corroborated what Brown had stated.

“Mark doesn’t care about publishers but is giving me a lot of leeway and concessions to make these changes,” Brown reportedly said, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “We will help you revitalize journalism… in a few years the reverse looks like I’ll be holding hands with your dying business like in a hospice.”

As The Guardian reported on Monday, Facebook is “vehemently” denying the veracity of the comments as reported by The Australian, referring to its own transcript of the meeting. However, Facebook is refusing to release its transcript and tape of the gathering.

Brown’s warning about the dire prospects for news outlets that don’t get on board with a future in which corporate giants like Facebook are the arbiters of what is and isn’t trustworthy news comes as progressives are raising alarm that Facebook’s entrance into the world of journalism poses a major threat to non-corporate and left-wing news outlets…

21WIRE says…

The recent “deplatforming” of Alex Jones and InfoWars from a number of social media sites is just the tip of a much larger iceberg. It is not hard to see that we are entering a future in which the removal of social media and other internet content will be influenced and carried out, not only by big tech firms such as YouTube and Facebook, but by politicians, foreign and domestic governments and social media users, as well as other private interests.

Although the simultaneous removal of Alex Jones from multiple platforms has grabbed headlines in both the mainstream press and independent media, in truth these moves have been underway for some time. As pointed out in the article below, the current movement to censor the internet can be partly traced back to events in Congress last November, when the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings targeting “Extremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online.”

In this sense, it is not only the social media companies themselves which are participating in this censorship; the hand of the state is also present to instigate it, pressuring the platforms to do it so that politicians are at least somewhat insulated from accusations of censorship.

There is also an international dimension to these moves, as various attempts to control internet content have taken place in countries as diverse as China, Israel and the Great Britain. In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May has been pressuring Silicon Valley to control content since even before the London Bridge attack in June 2017 when she declared war on online extremism.

Even here at 21WIRE we are not immune from this type of pressure and control. As we reported last year, changes to Google’s search algorithms caused a substantial and ongoing decrease in traffic coming to this website, and hundreds of others like it. Many sites in the independent/alternative media are suffering a similar fate — on both the left and the right. This is well documented now. The common factor among them seems to be their dissent from establishment narratives.

The Rolling Stone article reposted below does a good job of drawing attention to a number of these issues. However, as The Intercept‘s Glenn Greenwald highlights in the following tweets responding to the piece, the future may be grim. Not only will we see rival camps competing to censor their rivals’ content, but we are now on a course toward Chinese-style control and censorship, which unabashedly and directly silences political opposition.

The last thing Greenwald highlights from the Rolling Stone piece is that Americans “have lost the ability to distinguish between general principles and political outcomes.” In other words, freedom of speech is in grave danger, if it isn’t already gone. As is often stated, popular speech needs no protection. Therefore if we as a society do not protect unpopular speech, then we do not have free speech at all.

More on this from Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi…

Matt Taibbi

Rolling Stone

Silicon Valley is changing its mind about censorship.

Two weeks ago, we learned about a new campaign against “inauthentic” content, conducted by Facebook in consultation with Congress and the secretive think tank Atlantic Council — whose board includes an array of ex-CIA and Homeland Security officials — in the name of cracking down on alleged Russian disinformation efforts.­ As part of the bizarre alliance of Internet news distributors and quasi-government censors, the social network zapped 32 accounts and pages, including an ad for a real “No Unite the Right 2” anti-racist counter-rally in D.C. this past weekend.

“This is a real protest in Washington, D.C. It is not George Soros. It is not Russia. It is just us,” said the event’s organizers, a coalition of easily located Americans, in a statement.

Last week, we saw another flurry of censorship news. Facebook apparently suspended VenezuelaAnalysis.com, a site critical of U.S. policy toward Venezuela. (It was reinstated Thursday.) Twitter suspended a pair of libertarians, including @DanielLMcAdams of the Ron Paul Institute and @ScottHortonShow of Antiwar.com, for using the word “bitch” (directed toward a man) in a silly political argument. They, too, were later re-instated.

More significantly: Google’s former head of free expression issues in Asia, Lokman Tsui, blasted the tech giant’s plan to develop a search engine that would help the Chinese government censor content.

First reported by The Intercept, the plan was called “a stupid, stupid move” by Tsui, who added: “I can’t see a way to operate Google search in China without violating widely held international human rights standards.” This came on the heels of news that the Israeli Knesset passed a second reading of a “Facebook bill,” authorizing courts to delete content on security grounds.

Few Americans heard these stories, because the big “censorship” news last week surrounded the widely hated Alex Jones. After surviving halting actions by Facebook and YouTube the week before, the screeching InfoWars lunatic was hit decisively, removed from Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify.

Jones is the media equivalent of a trench-coated stalker who jumps out from behind a mailbox and starts whacking it in an intersection. His “speech” is on that level: less an idea than a gross physical provocation. InfoWars defines everything reporters are taught not to do.

Were I Alex Jones, I would think Alex Jones was a false-flag operation, cooked up to discredit the idea of a free press.

Moreover, Jones probably does violate all of those platforms’ Terms of Service. I personally don’t believe his Sandy Hook rants — in which he accused grieving parents of being actors in an anti-gun conspiracy — are protected speech, at least not according to current libel and defamation law. Even some conservative speech activists seem to agree.

And yet: I didn’t celebrate when Jones was banned. Collectively, all these stories represent a revolutionary moment in media. Jones is an incidental player in a much larger narrative.

Both the Jones situation and the Facebook-Atlantic Council deletions seem an effort to fulfill a request made last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Last October, Facebook, Google and Twitter were asked by Hawaii Senator Mazie Hizono to draw up a “mission statement” to “prevent the foment of discord.”

Companies like Facebook might have balked before. They have long taken a position that’s very Star Trek, very Prime-Directive: We do not interfere. Mark Zuckerberg, as late as 2016, was saying, “editing content… that’s not us.”

Part of this reluctance was probably ideological, but the main thing was the sheer logistical quandary of monitoring published content on the scale of a firm like Facebook. The company now has 2.23 billion users, and experts estimate that’s more than a billion new entries to monitor daily.

Although it might have seemed minor, undertaking what Facebook did prior to 2016 — keeping porn and beheading videos out of your news feed — was an extraordinarily involved technical process.

This was underscored by fiascoes like the “Napalm Girl” incident in 2016, when the firm deleted a picture of Kim Phúc, the nine-year-old Vietnamese girl photographed running from napalm in 1972. The iconic picture helped reverse global opinion about the Vietnam War.

Facebook ultimately put the photo back up after being ripped for “abusing its power.” This was absurd: The photo had been flagged by mostly automated processes, designed to keep naked pictures of pre-teens off the site.

As a former Facebook exec tells Rolling Stone: “Knowing that ‘Napalm Girl’ is one of the icons of international journalism isn’t part of the fucking algo.”

It would seem like madness to ask companies to expand that vast automated process to make far more difficult intellectual distinctions about journalistic quality. But that has happened.

After Trump’s shocking win in 2016, everyone turned to Facebook and Google to fix “fake news.” But nobody had a coherent definition of what constitutes it.

Many on the left lamented the Wikileaks releases of Democratic Party emails, but those documents were real news, and the complaint there was more about the motives of sources, and editorial emphasis, rather than accuracy…

With all the public furor about Cambridge Analytica the corporate media and political establishment has extremely careful to avoid mentioning the role of the George Soros-funded radical left-wing political organization Media Matters in data mining and advising social media monopolists on how to restrict content on their platforms under the cover of “fighting fake news”.

As it turns out, there is a clear, politically bias agenda which governs Facebook and others censorship algorithms. What these companies are doing is actually illegal and unconstitutional according to US law, but Washington’s corrupt political management class are afraid to hold Silicon Valley accountable – because the two parties are working together to the same authoritarian ends.

President Trump has signed a bill into law that cancels those regulations and could eventually allow internet service providers (ISPs) to sell information about their customers’ sensitive private data.

The law revokes regulations that would have required ISPs to obtain customer permission before collecting and sharing customer data such as web browsing history, app usage, geo-location data, and social security numbers; to notify customers about the type of information collected and shared; and to strengthen safeguards for customer data against hackers and thieves.

Under the new law, ISPs can monitor their users’ online activities and, without the users’ permission, sell highly targeted ads, and also sell the information to third parties such as marketers, financial firms, and other companies that gather personal data.

ISPs such as Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon opposed the FCC regulations as unfair and harsh because tech companies such as Facebook and Google would not have been subject to the regulations, leaving them free to collect user information without permission.

262020de1f5e4294979e94ed729d475e	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		President Trump and the Alt-right : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	President Trump and the Alt-right : Political Blind Spot	0	"In 2010, the term “alt-right” entered the political lexicon. It referred to a movement centered on white nationalism.

A few days after President Trump’s inauguration, a TV reporter was told by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, “Trump is a white nationalist, so to speak. He is alt-right whether he likes it or not.” A brief review of Trump’s actions during the first 100 days of his presidency seem to validate Spencer’s comment.

Many of Trump’s policies, intentionally or unintentionally, coincide with the white nationalist agenda. He has signed executive orders to begin building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico; to withhold federal funds from “sanctuary cities” that refuse to use local police to enforce federal immigration laws; and to suspended indefinitely the entry of Syrian refugees and temporarily barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The last two orders were not upheld in court. His administration has directed federal prosecutors to bring more felony charges against detained immigrants.

Trump has rescinded the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order which requires federal contractors to show they are in compliance with federal law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.

Some of Trump’s appointees hold views that are more radical right than mainstream. Among them are strategist Stephen Bannon, who turned Breitbart News into the platform for the alt-right; and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was denied a federal judgeship because of his racism and who was a powerful ally of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim extremist groups when he was U.S. senator from Alabama.

Sessions has indicated he will not continue the Justice Department’s work to curb discriminatory policing practices, will not attempt to reform sentencing laws for drug related crimes, and will discontinue the previous administration’s policy of reducing the federal government’s use of prisons operated by private, for-profit companies. Black Americans are disproportionately affected by these practices.

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke tweeted on January 31: “Everything I’ve been talking about for decades is coming true and the ideas I’ve fought for have won.”

c14f60f0103f4f7993987311928a009e	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		Education Secretary Booed at Black College Commencement : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	Education Secretary Booed at Black College Commencement : Political Blind Spot	0	"An unwelcome reception awaited U.S. Secretary Betsy DeVos as she delivered the commencement address on May 5 at Bethune-Cookman University (B-CU), a historically black college in Daytona Beach, Florida. B-CU has a student population of approximately 3,600.

Prior to DeVos’ arrival, a group delivered petitions with about 60,000 signatures asking B-CU officials to cancel her speech, and there had been a demonstration protesting her appearance with some protesters holding signs that read “DeVos No” and “Our tax $s pay for public education.” Prior to the commencement ceremony, activists lined the sidewalk outside the convention center where the event occurred. Some carried signs, one of which read “DeVos is not worthy.”

During the program, as B-CU President began to award DeVos an honorary degree, many students started to boo. More than half of the 380 graduates stood and turned their backs to her as she was introduced, and a dozen remained so during her entire speech. Seconds after she began delivering her speech, loud shouts filled the room. Some graduating students shouted “Liar!” and “Just go.” At times, the shouts were so loud DeVos could not be heard.

When DeVos said she wanted to “acknowledge the different life experiences” of those in the crowd, students responded with chants of “hell, nah.” When DeVos announced that later in the day she would visit the home and gravesite of B-CU founder Mary Bethune to pay her respects, another round of boos occurred, accompanied by some shouts of “No!” Although the commencement program indicated DeVos would speak for more than an hour, she ended her address after about 20 minutes.

One reason for the protest against DeVos as commencement speaker is her statement in February that founders of historically black colleges and universities were “real pioneers” of school choice. Actually, the schools were founded out of necessity during the era of segregation when black students were prohibited from attending white colleges. DeVos has recanted the statement, conceding that racism was the impetus for establishment of historically black colleges.

DeVos is also criticized for diverting tax money from public schools to private and charter schools, for reducing consumer protections for student loan repayment and amnesty programs, and for her past negative remarks on public education. Many B-CU students are graduates of public schools and depend on student loans to help finance their college education.

A graduate who received a master’s degree said, “DeVos was here to hear our differences and at the end of the day I think that’s what happened.”

612f8ff7d5ef483aab5c699be1d6df5e	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		Trump Gave Secret Information to Russians : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	Trump Gave Secret Information to Russians : Political Blind Spot	0	"According to former and current U.S. officials, President Trump disclosed highly classified information to a Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador to U.S. during a meeting with the Russian dignitaries in the Oval Office. The information is so sensitive that details have not been shared with allies and have been restricted within the U.S. government. It is described as “code-word” information, referring to the highest classification level that American information (spy) agencies use.

Immediately after the meeting, White House officials tried to minimize the damage by alerting the CIA and the National Security Agency. They hoped to prevent hostility from the source.

At one point during the meeting, Trump seemed to be bragging, saying, “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day.” He then described details about how ISIS plans to use laptop computers as bombs on planes, and although he did not share the specific intelligence gathering method, he did indicate the city within ISIS territory where the information was obtained. Additional information about the content of the President’s disclosure is not being published for reasons of national security.

The incident gave officials several reasons for concern. First, Trump discussed parts of the plan that were known to the U.S only because of the efforts of a key U.S. intelligence partner; by sharing the information, Trump placed the provider of that information in danger since Russia may be able to figure out the source.

A second concern is that exposure of this important source of information about the Islamic State could become an obstacle to the ability of the U.S. and U.S. allies to find out about future threats. There is also concern that the President compromised national security by reducing the likelihood that U.S. allies will share intelligence with Washington.

Another concern is that the incident may erode the trust essential for sharing information. Rules of espionage hold that governments and individual agencies decide how and to whom information they gather is distributed, even after it is shared. Trump violated this rule: The information was not his to share.

Since one of the powers of the President is to declassify information at any time he chooses, the President did not break any laws and so it is not likely that he will be legally prosecuted for this extremely serious breach of protocol.

President Trump indicated early on that he plans to retain his presidency: he filed his intention to run for re-election on January 20, the day he was inaugurated. By Filing, early Trump can accept campaign contributions throughout his current term. He has already set up a re-election committee and his campaign released the first ad of the 2020 campaign.

According to NPR, the 2016 election may have been the beginning of a new tendency in presidential elections in which the experience of holding public office or of being a public servant is no longer required. Instead, wealth, power, and celebrity are considered acceptable qualifications.

It is also noted by NPR that presidential elections have become treated like reality shows and give presidential candidates too much attention compared to the actual power they have. Concomitantly, lower-level, closer-to-home elections receive much less attention from voters and the media.

The majority of those persons filing for the 2020 presidential campaign are activists, but there are also business persons and a Hollywood actor with no political experience.

Rumored to be among Trump’s Democratic challengers are Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Names of wealthy non-politicians rumored to be contenders for the presidency include Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former Starbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz. Others rumored to be interesting in running for the presidency include rapper and entrepreneur Kanye West, and professional wrestler and actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.

fd98d950732e486eb0f53999ef06ff3f	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		The REAL ‘Lone Ranger’ Was An African American Lawman Who Lived With Native American Indians : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	The REAL ‘Lone Ranger’ Was An African American Lawman Who Lived With Native American Indians : Political Blind Spot	0	"The real “Lone Ranger,” it turns out, was an African American man named Bass Reeves, who the legend was based upon. Perhaps not surprisingly, many aspects of his life were written out of the story, including his ethnicity. The basics remained the same: a lawman hunting bad guys, accompanied by a Native American, riding on a white horse, and with a silver trademark.

Historians of the American West have also, until recently, ignored the fact that this man was African American, a free black man who headed West to find himself less subject to the racist structure of the established Eastern and Southern states.

While historians have largely overlooked Reeves, there have been a few notable works on him. Vaunda Michaux Nelson’s book, Bad News for Outlaws: The Remarkable Life of Bass Reeves, Deputy U.S. Marshal, won the 2010 Coretta Scott King Award for best author. Arthur Burton released an overview of the man’s life a few years ago. Black Gun, Silver Star: The Life and Legend of Frontier Marshal Bass Reeves recounts that Reeves was born into a life of slavery in 1838. His slave-keeper brought him along as another personal servant when he went off to fight with the Confederate Army, during the Civil War.

Reeves took the chaos that ensued during the war to escape for freedom, after beating his “master” within an inch of his life, or according to some sources, to death. Perhaps the most intruiging thing about this escape was that Reeves only beat his enslaver after the latter lost sorely at a game of cards with Reeves and attacked him.

After successfully defending himself from this attack, he knew that there was no way he would be allowed to live if he stuck around.

Reeves fled to the then Indian Territory of today’s Oklahoma and lived harmoniously among the Seminole and Creek Nations of Native American Indians.

After the Civil War finally concluded, he married and eventually fathered ten children, making his living as a Deputy U.S. Marshall in Arkansas and the Indian Territory. If this surprises you, it should, as Reeves was the first African American to ever hold such a position.

Burton explains that it was at this point that the Lone Ranger story comes in to play. Reeves was described as a “master of disguises”. He used these disguises to track down wanted criminals, even adopting similar ways of dressing and mannerisms to meet and fit in with the fugitives, in order to identify them.

Reeves kept and gave out silver coins as a personal trademark of sorts, just like the Lone Ranger’s silver bullets. Of course, the recent Disney adaptation of the Lone Ranger devised a clever and meaningful explanation for the silver bullets in the classic tales. For the new Lone Ranger, the purposes was to not wantonly expend ammunition and in so doing devalue human life. But in the original series, there was never an explanation given, as this was simply something originally adapted from Reeves’ personal life and trademarking of himself. For Reeves, it had a very different meaning, he would give out the valuable coins to ingratiate himself to the people wherever he found himself working, collecting bounties. In this way, a visit from the real “Lone Ranger” meant only good fortune for the town: a criminal off the street and perhaps a lucky silver coin.

Like the Lone Ranger, Reeves was also expert crack shot with a gun. According to legend, shooting competitions had an informal ban on allowing him to enter. Like the Lone Ranger, Reeves rode a white horse throughout almost all of his career, at one point riding a light grey one as well.

Like the famed Lone Ranger legend Reeves had his own close friend like Tonto. Reeves’ companion was a Native American posse man and tracker who he often rode with, when he was out capturing bad guys. In all, there were close to 3000 of such criminals they apprehended, making them a legendary duo in many regions.

The final proof that this legend of Bass Reeves directly inspired into the story of the Lone Ranger can be found in the fact that a large number of those criminals were sent to federal prison in Detroit. The Lone Ranger radio show originated and was broadcast to the public in 1933 on WXYZ in Detroit where the legend of Reeves was famous only two years earlier.

Of course, WXYZ and the later TV and movie adaptions weren’t about to make the Lone Ranger an African American who began his career by beating a slave-keeper to death. But now you know. Spread the word and let people know the real legend of the Lone Ranger.

755c132b4ec8487cb85553088dfb1bae	['Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		Data Reveals Measles Outbreaks Have Nothing to Do With Non-Vaccination Trends : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	Data Reveals Measles Outbreaks Have Nothing to Do With Non-Vaccination Trends : Political Blind Spot	0	"Whatever we might each think about the decision to not vaccinate ourselves or our children, one thing is clear: vaccination is a heated topic and debates about it often result in polarization. Maybe another thing is clear too: most opinions about vaccination (for or against) are influenced more by editorials on the subject, than by data itself. Thus, here is one more editorial on the subject, albeit one that does not pass judgment on vaccinations, for or against. It is, instead, intended as a call to research, and a reminder of the scientific maxim: correlation is not causation. That goes for both sides of this debate.

On the anti-vaccination side, there are many claims made that are often based on things that the data might imply, but is far from proving. This results in many ideas that are later discredited being circulated as fact.

On the pro-vaccination side, every time there is a measles outbreak, it seems mainstream news outlets trip over themselves to implicate “the growing trend to opt out of vaccinations” as the cause (read: causation). Again, “correlation is not causation”. Here’s why…

If the measles outbreaks in California, and particularly in and around Orange County, as well as New York City are because of non-vaccinators, then why aren’t we seeing outbreaks of everything not being vaccinated for? Why just measles and why all of a sudden, when the number of people opting out of vaccinations has actually steadily dropped in the last few years – after an initial wave of people not doing it?

Non-vaccinators in NY are .1-1% of the population. In California we are talking 1.1-2%. Why aren’t we seeing increases in outbreaks in Vermont, Michigan and Oregon where the rate is over 6%? Correlation (or worse yet, public perception of correlation), is not causation: whether it’s vaccines and autism, or whether it’s a tiny number of people not vaccinating, and a few places having measles outbreaks.

What does the data show on measles in the states where opting out of vaccination trends the highest? There was an instance in Oregon last year, and one this year with a 6% rate of opting out in the state. A child in Washington County, Oregon who developed measles on an overseas trip and exposed hundreds of people in the Portland area. Add to that one case in Oregon this year where a child contracted measles from a vaccinated adult.

Shouldn’t the state be the worst off? And where are Vermont’s outbreaks at 6% non-vaccination?

Measles has been trending down, but in the past year it has spiked in the U.S. in spite of the trend of non-vaccination dropping a bit. Measles outbreaks have been happening all over the world in the past year, even and especially where there is no significant increase of anti-vaccination trends (Turkey, Vietnam, Philippines and several countries in Europe). It’s up in California which likely is accounted for by the fact that there is so much travel in California from abroad. The 2013 case in Oregon? That was a traveller too, who had been in and out of international airports before contracting the disease. Same thing with New York City where outbreaks have been happening at a rate higher than the statistical norm.

States with the highest non-vaccination rates have not seen an increase in measles outbreaks that are statistically significant. News websites like to run with headlines that will get people to share, and vent outrage. But that doesn’t make such articles a good source of scientific data.

Remember, if you take nothing else away from this: correlation is not causation. Just because you heard on the news that there are a lot of people not vaccinating their children (an exaggerated statement, to be sure), does not mean that the rise in measles globally is due to families in Utah refusing vaccinations across the board. This is all the more so when the correlation does not even overlap the places where vaccine refusal is the highest.

Do some research. Use the search field on the CDC website. Hit your local University library up and search scholarly journals and databases. The data on these issues is not hiding, but it will not deliver itself to your email inbox without a little work. When you do the research you’ll find that the facts are not quite as sensational as many headlines might have you believe. There has been a recent spike in measles. That much is clear. But it is happening all over the world and it is actually not happening in places where people are refusing vaccinations the most. Whatever your position is on vaccinations, get the facts and don’t spread assumptions made by lazy writers. Again, that goes for both sides of the vaccination issue.

Barbara Mikulski, one of just two female senators in office at the time, who pushed for Ms. Hill to testify, had some advice for the committee.“How you treat her with respect is to take it seriously. You also treat Judge Kavanaugh with respect,” Ms. Mikulski told me. “You do an investigation. And then you hold a hearing, not a trial.”____________________What both sides are sayingThere’s a lot being written about how the Senate should handle the accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh. We read through it all to break down the arguments coming from the left and the right.Liberals have almost universally called for a deeper investigation before the Senate votes to confirm. Here’s what they are saying:• A Supreme Court position is too important to hurry.“The urgency is to investigate, not to rush to confirm a lifetime appointment. Surely a few Republican senators retain enough sense of institutional responsibility to insist on that.” — Ruth Marcus, The Washington Post• Kavanaugh’s honesty is on trial.“Kavanaugh has denied that he did it … If Ford’s allegation is true, then Kavanaugh has lied to the public.” — Nathan J. Robinson, Current AffairsConservatives, meanwhile, are split. While some have echoed the same concerns as their liberal counterparts, many still believe an investigation is not warranted. Here’s what they are saying:• The allegations are too old to be proven.“There is no way to confirm her story after 35 years … This is simply too distant and uncorroborated a story to warrant a new hearing or to delay a vote.” — Wall Street Journal editorial board• The way Democrats brought the case forward is suspect.“If Kavanaugh’s confirmation is derailed, the precedent will be set. Whenever the stakes are high enough, the most sinister, underhanded forces of the left will manage to surface an unsubstantiated character-destroying allegation at the most opportune moment.” — Buck Sexton, The Hill____________________The mayor and his moneyOur colleague Alexander Burns, a national political correspondent, sends us this dispatch about how one former (and perhaps future?) politician is trying to influence this year’s elections:Michael R. Bloomberg’s plan to spend $80 million supporting Democratic congressional candidates has fueled one of the biggest guessing games in midterm politics: How’s he going to spend it? Where? For whom?Mr. Bloomberg didn’t name all of his targets in an interview, but he offered some clues.“We are looking for candidates, number one, that are good on the environment and guns in particular,” he told me. “And then candidates where we think that they have a chance, and candidates that we think aren’t guaranteed to win.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/politics/17onpolitics-pm-2/17onpolitics-pm-2-facebookJumbo.jpg01c05cad693d4087a16d734fab077298	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Hearing Set for Monday to Hear Kavanaugh and His Accuser	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Hearing Set for Monday to Hear Kavanaugh and His Accuser	1	"By Monday morning, however, with Dr. Blasey’s lawyer saying Dr. Blasey was willing to appear in front of Congress, Mr. McGahn and others changed course and agreed that Judge Kavanaugh should put out his statement.“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone,” the statement said. “Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.”On Capitol Hill on Monday, Mr. Grassley and Mr. McConnell initially resisted calls for hearings, and instead arranged telephone calls to allow Republican and Democratic aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey — a plan that Mr. Schumer rejected as “a biased, far-fetched process.”But by day’s end, Republican leaders concluded that it would be necessary to move forward to satisfy the concerns of senators in both parties.Still, there were other Republicans who feared the committee had made a dangerous misstep in agreeing so quickly to a public hearing. Without having fully deposed either Dr. Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh, these Republicans fear that the party and the White House could unexpectedly and irrevocably lose control of the nomination when the witnesses take the stand.Both in the letter to Ms. Feinstein and in an interview published Sunday by The Washington Post, Dr. Blasey said that during a gathering of teenagers at a private home in suburban Montgomery County, Md., the future Judge Kavanaugh, along with a friend, pushed her into a bedroom as she was making her way to a bathroom. She said the young Mr. Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, grinding his body against hers as he tried to remove her clothing. When she tried to scream, she said, he clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle the cries.“They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state,” she wrote in the letter, made public Monday by CNN. “With Kavanaugh’s hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/politics/18dc-kavanaugh-sub/18dc-kavanaugh-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg6b3e5b4e48ee4cac88cee29d1fd4056d	[]	2018-09-16 00:00:00	Kavanaugh’s Nomination in Turmoil as Accuser Says He Assaulted Her Decades Ago	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Kavanaugh’s Nomination in Turmoil as Accuser Says He Assaulted Her Decades Ago	1	"The new revelation prompted a hurried effort by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, to set up conference calls to allow Democratic and Republican aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Ford before Thursday’s scheduled committee vote. A spokesman, Garrett Ventry, said it was routine to hold such calls “when updates are made to nominees’ background files.”Senate Republican leaders in the hours after The Post’s article was published indicated that they intended to move forward with voting on him. Republicans planned to argue that unless corroborating information came to light, they had no way of verifying her story and saw no reason to delay the vote, according to a person involved in the discussions.The decision about any delay in the vote could rest on the opinions of two Republican women: Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Both are publicly undecided about Judge Kavanaugh.Ms. Collins said in an interview on Sunday night that she considered the allegations serious and that Ms. Ford needed to be personally interviewed to get a fuller account. But Ms. Collins, who could conceivably decide the outcome in the narrowly divided Senate, said Democrats had done a disservice to both Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh with their handling of the accusations.“What is puzzling to me is the Democrats, by not bringing this out earlier, after having had this information for more than six weeks, have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge,” she said. “If they believed Professor Ford, why didn’t they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didn’t believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it is was handled.”The White House, which has taken great pains to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a champion of women, sought to bolster him by pointing to statements by women who have known him and testified to his character. Those included a letter from 65 women who said that they knew him in high school and that he had “always treated women with decency and respect.”Advisers to Mr. Trump were trying to avoid publicly assailing the accuser while hoping that the lack of contemporaneous corroboration for Ms. Ford’s account would mean that Senate Republicans could move ahead without addressing it in detail."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/politics/17dc-kavanaugh/17dc-kavanaugh-facebookJumbo.jpgf9f69b0647214746b986cae38ad44292	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Trump Hits China With Tariffs on $200 Billion in Goods, Escalating Trade War	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Trump Hits China With Tariffs on $200 Billion in Goods, Escalating Trade War	1	"Trade analysts said Mr. Trump’s approach risked further confrontation with the Chinese.“Washington’s view seems to be that tariffs and threats of more tariffs will soften up the Chinese and make them more amenable to negotiations,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist who specializes in trade issues. “The evidence that, in response to U.S. bullying tactics, China just stiffens its spine and strikes back with proportionate tariffs against U.S. imports has had no discernible effect on the Trump administration’s take-no-prisoners approach to this rapidly escalating trade war.”China is expected to further retaliate against the United States, and top officials have warned that could include penalizing American companies that rely on Chinese components for phones, cars, televisions and other products. China’s commerce ministry has said that it is ready to put similar tariffs on $60 billion a year of American goods in response to the threat from the United States. China has matched previous tariff moves dollar for dollar, but the number of American goods to tax is dwindling because, for many years, it has only imported about a quarter as much as it exports to the United States.Lou Jiwei, China’s finance minister until his recent retirement and now a senior Communist Party adviser, delivered an unexpectedly strong threat to the United States in a lunch speech at the forum, which is organized by a government agency reporting directly to the cabinet. Mr. Lou said that, if necessary in the trade war, China could halt exports to the United States of components that are crucial to American companies’ supply chains.Mr. Lou said that it would take years for American companies to find alternatives to China. “To take a step back, the United States can establish an alternative supply chain in a third country, but it takes time — what about the pain of three to five years? This is enough to cross a political cycle,” he said.American businesses — which have warned that tariffs could hurt profits, force job cuts and, in some cases, destroy companies, said the taxes were going to hurt the United States more than the administration realized. The National Association of Chemical Distributors released a study this month that predicted nearly 28,000 chemical distributor and supplier jobs would be eliminated because of higher prices from the $200 billion round of tariffs.“These tariffs are going to be paid for by the working families who drive our economy,” said Jonathan Gold, a spokesman for a business group formed to fight tariffs called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland. “Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. By choosing to unilaterally raise taxes on Americans, the cost of running a farm, factory or business will grow. In many cases, these costs will be passed on to American families.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/business/00dc-chinatariffs-1/00dc-chinatariffs-1-facebookJumbo.jpgc325a9b49553432bad18c2a2a75b582a	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Trump Says Tariffs Will Save American Factories. History Shows Otherwise.	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Trump Says Tariffs Will Save American Factories. History Shows Otherwise.	1	"WASHINGTON — President Trump is building a wall of tariffs around the domestic economy, attempting to protect American jobs by limiting imports. But a tire factory that opened last year in Richburg, S.C., offers a reminder that globalization is hard to stop.In 2009, American tire makers persuaded the Obama administration to impose tariffs on Chinese tires, and imports of tires from China fell sharply. But Chinese companies did not stop making tires in response to the tariffs — they simply moved production to other places, including to the United States.Giti, one of the largest tire makers in China, built the South Carolina factory to make low-cost tires for Walmart. Two other Chinese tire companies are building plants in the neighboring states of Georgia and North Carolina, and a fourth Chinese company acquired a tire factory in Georgia this year.Mr. Trump on Monday said the United States would begin imposing tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 24, on top of the $50 billion worth of products he previously taxed. The new tariffs hit many of the consumer products that Americans use every day, like food, clothing and electronics, and the president threatened to go even further, saying he is prepared to tax all Chinese imports if Beijing retaliates."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/17dc-tariffs1/17dc-tariffs-facebookJumbo.jpgd9693507755a43d3b743b9b6eb15bfe0	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Florence Live Updates: Rivers Still Rising as Storm Pushes Away	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Florence Live Updates: Rivers Still Rising as Storm Pushes Away	1	"WILMINGTON, N.C. — Emergency workers rushed into beleaguered cities across the Carolinas on Monday as residents struggled with the aftermath of a storm that drenched the region with record rainfall, damaged tens of thousands of homes and delivered floodwaters that may not recede for days.Even as the remnants of Hurricane Florence pulled away, it was clear that the turmoil had only begun.Wilmington, one of North Carolina’s most populous cities, was virtually cut off. Floodwaters pushed ever higher in some communities as the rains flowed into rivers and rushed downstream.The authorities in North and South Carolina rescued more people by air and water.

Ms. Monk had been in a family shelter in Columbia, S.C., that ground down her soul, she said. At Trent Court, she could gaze out her front door onto the wide, rippling river. She could take in its breeze, its smell, its changing colors and moods.This week, after a brief evacuation, she returned to Trent Court to find that flooding from Florence had turned her place into a sodden wreck. She also realized that she was now a player in the kind of redevelopment drama that tends to swamp storm-battered places like this — a story of race, class, gentrification and safety fears, and questions without easy answers about who gets to live on often alluring, sometimes treacherous, waterside real estate."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/18newbern-02/18newbern-02-facebookJumbo.jpgf2b36a31f7c84fa9bb0c64a099c53c84	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Trump to Cap Refugees Allowed Into U.S. at 30,000, a Record Low	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Trump to Cap Refugees Allowed Into U.S. at 30,000, a Record Low	1	"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to cap the number of refugees that can be resettled in the United States next year at 30,000, his administration announced on Monday, further cutting an already drastically scaled-back program that offers protection to foreigners fleeing violence and persecution.Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, announced the limit at the State Department, saying it reflected the “daunting operational reality” of addressing what he called a “humanitarian crisis” involving people claiming asylum in the United States.The number represents the lowest ceiling a president has placed on the refugee program since its creation in 1980, and a reduction of a third from the 45,000-person limit that Mr. Trump set for 2018.The move is the latest in a series of efforts the president has made to clamp down on immigration to the United States."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/politics/18dc-refugees-1/18dc-refugees-1-facebookJumbo.jpg017e6c3cc442440b9f69871ed55d99ce	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Bloomberg May Run for President as a Democrat. Some of His Views May Cause Him Trouble.	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Bloomberg May Run for President as a Democrat. Some of His Views May Cause Him Trouble.	1	"In the interview Friday — his first extended comments on his thinking about a 2020 presidential run — Mr. Bloomberg expressed stubbornly contrary views on those fronts. He criticized liberal Democrats’ attitude toward big business, endorsing certain financial regulations but singling out a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to break up Wall Street banks as wrongheaded. He also defended his mayoral administration’s policy of stopping people on the street to search them for guns, a police tactic that predominantly affected black and Latino men, as a necessary expedient against crime.And while Mr. Bloomberg expressed concern about allegations of sexual misconduct that have arisen in the last year, he also voiced doubt about some of them and said only a court could determine their veracity. He gave as an example Charlie Rose, the disgraced television anchor who for years broadcast his eponymous talk show from the offices of Mr. Bloomberg’s company.“The stuff I read about is disgraceful — I don’t know how true all of it is,” Mr. Bloomberg said of the #MeToo movement. Raising Mr. Rose unprompted, he said: “We never had a complaint, whatsoever, and when I read some of the stuff, I was surprised, I will say. But I never saw anything and we have no record, we’ve checked very carefully.”Mr. Bloomberg said the media industry was guilty of not “standing up” against sexual misconduct sooner, but declined to say whether he believed the allegations against Mr. Rose. “Let the court system decide,” he said, while acknowledging that the claims involving Mr. Rose might never be adjudicated in a legal proceeding.Mr. Rose, 76, has been accused by numerous women of unwanted and coercive sexual behavior, including claims that he groped female subordinates and exposed himself to them. He was fired by both CBS, where he hosted a morning show, and PBS, which broadcast the program “Charlie Rose,” which Mr. Rose recorded in the Bloomberg office. Bloomberg TV also terminated an arrangement that allowed it to rebroadcast Mr. Rose’s show.“You know, is it true?” Mr. Bloomberg said of the allegations. “You look at people that say it is, but we have a system where you have — presumption of innocence is the basis of it.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/18bloomberg1/18bloomberg1-facebookJumbo.jpgc55da17ad415443f9febf3a2df407494	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Ted Cruz’s Campaign Marked a Fund-Raising Letter an Official ‘Summons.’ It Wasn’t Against the Rules.	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Ted Cruz’s Campaign Marked a Fund-Raising Letter an Official ‘Summons.’ It Wasn’t Against the Rules.	1	"Ted Cruz’s Senate re-election campaign has been sending voters in Texas a fund-raising letter in an envelope labeled “summons enclosed,” drawing criticism from some who called it misleading and raising questions about whether such a practice was legal. It is.That is according to Myles Martin, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, who said the salient question was whether a mailing contains a disclaimer saying that it came from a political campaign. And this one did.Aside from that, he said in an email, “the F.E.C.’s regulations don’t speak to how candidates may choose to word particular solicitations to potential contributors.”Mr. Cruz is locked in an unexpectedly tight race against Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso, in a traditionally conservative state. Earlier this month, a top adviser to President Trump, Mick Mulvaney, the federal budget director, told a gathering of donors he believed it was possible Mr. Cruz might not win re-election because he is not “likable.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/politics/18cruzmail2/18cruzmail2-facebookJumbo.jpg9b554c7092bb4ad394c1c65c928465fb	['John Koblin']	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Emmys 2018 Live Updates: A Marriage Proposal Onstage	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Emmys 2018 Live Updates: A Marriage Proposal Onstage	1	"While both are favorites, they have their vulnerabilities. The most recent episode of “Thrones” aired 13 months ago, which may have left Emmy voters trying to recall what happened in its long-ago seventh season. And many supporters of “Handmaid’s” — who have propelled the series into a red-cloaked cultural landmark — had mixed feelings about its second-season finale.PhotoThe plausible challengers for the best drama statuette are “The Americans,” the FX show about Russian spies, and Netflix’s sweeping study of Queen Elizabeth, “The Crown.”[Stream these 10 Emmy nominated shows you may not have seen.]The FX drama, which completed its six-season run in May, has won only two Emmys, but it has long been a critical favorite. And Emmy voters have been known to shower love on a show on its way out, as they did for “The Sopranos” and “Breaking Bad.”“The Crown,” meanwhile, won best cast in a drama at the Creative Arts Emmys a week ago, an occasional bellwether; four of the past eight best drama winners also won for best cast. Because the series will bring aboard new cast members every few years, this is also a last chance for Emmy voters to recognize the iteration of the show starring Claire Foy, who will cede the role of the queen to Olivia Colman as the show moves into the mid-1960s.Lorne Michaels and the ‘S.N.L.’ EffectPhotoLorne Michaels, the 73-year-old impresario behind “Saturday Night Live” and NBC’s late-night lineup, is producing the show for the second time, having last overseen the broadcast in 1988, when the “Dynasty” star John Forsythe was the host.NBC hoped that the hosts, Colin Jost and Michael Che, the anchors of Weekend Update on “S.N.L.,” would help reverse a trend of plummeting awards show ratings.In addition to giving the hosting job to Mr. Jost and Mr. Che, Mr. Michaels recruited a number of current and former “S.N.L.” cast members. The show began with a musical spoof live on stage about how Hollywood’s diversity problems are all history. “Yup, we solved it!” exclaimed Kenan Thompson, who was joined on stage beside Kate McKinnon, RuPaul and Andy Samberg, among others.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIn a way, it has been surprising to see the New York-based “S.N.L.” front and center at the Emmys. The Television Academy, the main body behind the awards, has looked askance at the show for most of its 43-year run.But that has changed, with “S.N.L.” having won nearly half of its 61 Emmys in the past five years. Last year, it won the best variety sketch Emmy, the first time it had claimed a top show award since 1993.Although many critics felt that “S.N.L.” had an off year this past season, it is nevertheless still scoring: After last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys, it is tied for first with “Game of Thrones” among all TV shows, with seven wins. Those include Tiffany Haddish for best guest actress in a comedy and Don Roy King for directing.‘Mrs. Maisel’ wins big in comedyPhotoAmazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” about a comedian in 1950s New York, got off to a huge start, winning four awards.Rachel Brosnahan won the Emmy for best actress in a comedy, the first new winner in that category in seven years. (With HBO’s “Veep” sidelined this year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus hit the pause button on her record-breaking Emmy run.) The show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, won two Emmys, one for directing and one for writing. And Alex Borstein, who plays Mrs. Maisel’s manager, won for best supporting actress.The triumph of “Mrs. Maisel” was a blow to the avant-garde FX comedy “Atlanta,” which was snubbed. Donald Glover, the show’s star and creator, took the prize for best actor in a comedy last year. This time, he lost out to Bill Hader, who plays a hit man trying to make it as an actor in “Barry.”In another win for “Barry,” Henry Winkler, 72, won his first Emmy for his role as a well-intentioned but cheesy acting coach. Mr. Winkler, who attained network stardom in the 1970s playing Fonzie on the ABC sitcom “Happy Days,” had been nominated five times before. Before thanking his co-workers and family members, he noted that he had written his acceptance speech “43 years ago.”In the late-night battle, John Oliver’s weekly HBO show, “Last Week Tonight,” seems poised to take the best variety talk category for a third year in a row. But last year’s Emmys host, Stephen Colbert, the host of “The Late Show” on CBS, is still surging in the ratings, giving him the potential to topple his former Comedy Central colleague.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyExpect #MeToo to have a big roleIn the last year, many TV stars, including Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K. and Mark Halperin have been forced out after facing allegations of sexual misconduct. Earlier this month, the #MeToo movement reached into the corporate side of the business, when multiple accusations of sexual misconduct led to the ouster of the CBS president and chief executive Leslie Moonves.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Tonight’s Emmys show is the first one to be broadcast since the first investigative article on accusations against Harvey Weinstein was published in The New York Times last October, meaning that it presents the first opportunity for the television industry at this ceremony.Mr. Che introduced himself by welcoming “the many, many talented people in Hollywood who haven’t been caught yet.”Invocations of Mr. Trump were never far from the lips of Emmy hosts and winners during the last two broadcasts. While hosting the 2016 edition of the show, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel called out Mark Burnett, the prolific reality show producer who produced Mr. Trump in “The Apprentice,” saying he would be the man to blame if Mr. Trump won. And at last year’s Emmys, at virtually every turn, Mr. Colbert and a number of the winners got in on the act of criticizing the president.In recent years, Mr. Trump’s presence has overwhelmed this ceremony, but winners and hosts have taken a break so far from bashing the president this year. Mr. Che and Mr. Jost never used his name in their opening remarks. And most winners, like Ms. Brosnahan, have stayed away from third rail political fare, instead encouraging viewers to “show up and vote” at this year’s midterm elections.It’s Netflix versus HBOIt’s the battle of bragging rights.During last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys, HBO put 17 Emmys on the scoreboard. Netflix was right behind, with 16. Executives from both companies will be fidgeting in their seats as they watch for the outcome of a contest that may mean more to the television industry than it does to viewers.HBO has won the most Emmys of any network each year since 2002. But in a sign that the jewel of cable may not dominate the ceremony for much longer, Netflix snapped HBO’s 17-year streak of leading all competitors in Emmy nominations earlier this summer.PhotoThere will be 26 awards handed out during Monday’s ceremony, a total that is slightly greater than the number of categories on the Oscar and Golden Globe broadcasts. Last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys gave golden statuettes to winners in nearly 100 categories.But the supersize nature of the Emmys is a reflection of where television is these days, now that streaming companies like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are taking up more of viewers’ time and challenging the industry’s old economic model. By year’s end, there will have been more than 500 scripted shows produced by United States-based broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, which will set yet another record.As a result, Emmy campaigning has grown more intense. So-called For Your Consideration events — panel discussions where voters have access to stars, canapés and booze — have filled the schedules of the more than 23,000 members of the Television Academy in the run-up to the 70th edition of the show. Last year, there were 61 academy-sanctioned events in Los Angeles and New York during Emmy campaigning season. This year, that number ballooned to 116, according to a spokesman for the academy."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/arts/18emmys-hp-slide-1J25/18emmys-hp-slide-1J25-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg97cd5e60f01d4a798b04392d6a16d8a1	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Issa Rae and Sandra Oh Look Ready to Win on the Emmys 2018 Red Carpet	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Issa Rae and Sandra Oh Look Ready to Win on the Emmys 2018 Red Carpet	1	"It’s that time of year again: the time when most people fail to realize the Emmys are on.Just kidding!

She serves on the board of several organizations and was a co-founder in 2011 of a short-term residential community for homeless families in San Francisco. She declined to be interviewed.The hands-off policy might not last, given the deep gloom over physical magazines.“Marc Benioff is a guy who wants whatever he touches to succeed,” said Phil Bronstein, a longtime Bay Area newsman. “If that’s going to require him to be involved, he’ll do it.”Mr. Benioff is deeply embedded in the Bay Area. His grandfather helped build the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, and his father ran a chain of clothing stores in the city. He began writing software as a teenager and briefly wrote code in the mid-1980s at Apple during the original tenure of Steve Jobs. But he first broke into prominence during a 13-year stint at Oracle, a dominant supplier of databases and other software. There Mr. Benioff was schooled in sales and strategy by one of Silicon Valley’s most brash leaders, Larry Ellison.Mr. Benioff, though he calls Mr. Ellison his mentor, broke from Oracle’s practices in significant ways when he started Salesforce. His start-up, founded in an apartment on San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill in 1999, opted not to sell software that customers would install on their own computers. Rather, Salesforce ran its offerings — which initially automated sales tasks like tracking customer histories — on its own computers and delivered them to corporations over the internet.This strategy reduced technical expenses and headaches for customers, while allowing Salesforce to make initial sales to small groups of employees at companies that would expand over time.It was a risky bet, because the web could be unreliable. But what would later be called a “cloud” model gradually became the dominant way for start-ups to deliver software. Even Mr. Ellison, who once derided the term, was an early investor in Salesforce and has turned Oracle into a major supplier of cloud-based offerings."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/business/18benioff-silo/merlin_136625550_5781b17c-7536-42a0-a655-f1bc63f18b3c-facebookJumbo.jpg5b2ba14dd28c4301a55610907bdbff6d	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	After Fetching a High Price, Time Magazine Moves Into a New Era	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	After Fetching a High Price, Time Magazine Moves Into a New Era	1	"Mr. Benioff is the latest tech billionaire to take the reins of a historic news brand. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013, and last year, Laurene Powell Jobs, who heads the Emerson Collective and is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, bought a majority stake of The Atlantic magazine.Media outlets have also become attractive to billionaires focused on philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Benioff has spoken out on the gender pay gap and protested an Indiana law that critics said discriminated against people who are gay or transgender. He said he would stay away from Time’s editorial decisions.But the re-emergence of billionaire media proprietors isn’t a sign the news profession is bouncing back, said Kyle Pope, the editor in chief of the Columbia Journalism Review.“Let’s not read anything more into this about the health of newsmagazines,” he said. “Most papers and magazines across the country are still desperate.”He added: “Iconic magazines like Time will always have a suitor because people like Benioff will always want to own these things. It's a good way to keep these titles going, but it doesn’t seem like it’s good for journalism writ large.”With Time, Mr. Benioff and his wife will face challenges. The magazine’s revenue inched past $170 million last year with profits around $25 million, according to two of the people familiar with its finances.Expenses at Meredith’s magazine division grew by more than $566 million with the addition of Time Inc., while profits shrank by more than a third to $98 million in the 12 months ending in June, when the company reports its fiscal year."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/business/18TIMEINC-top/18TIMEINC-top-facebookJumbo.jpga78c9225a6e74206b7383d5241bf07fd	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | #BrettToo?	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | #BrettToo?	1	"What happened between two teenagers at a suburban Maryland house party on a night more than three decades ago? Since one of them has been identified by the other as Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge who is now up for a seat on the United States Supreme Court, the Senate correctly decided to hear from Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser next week before proceeding with his confirmation.The accusations are detailed and appalling. Christine Blasey Ford, now a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, says she was 15 years old on the night in question when a “highly inebriated” Brett Kavanaugh, then 17, pushed her into a bedroom, locked the door and turned on loud music to mask her cries for help. She says he climbed on top of her, held a hand over her mouth and tried to take her clothes off. “I feared he may inadvertently kill me,” Dr. Blasey wrote in a July letter for her congresswoman to pass along to Senator Dianne Feinstein.Judge Kavanaugh has flatly denied any wrongdoing. “I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” he said in a statement.This is the sort of denial that an innocent man would offer. It is also increasingly the modus operandi in the age of Donald Trump, regardless of the accusations at hand: Don’t engage with the specifics, just deny, deny, deny."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17kavanaugh/merlin_143888694_028adfa7-266a-4720-acaa-2772b999d710-facebookJumbo.jpg18245cc7c91b4a32b448ca959364b3cc	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | Boys Will Be Supreme Court Justices	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Boys Will Be Supreme Court Justices	1	"Kavanaugh denies the allegation unequivocally; on Monday he said he’s willing to rebut it before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Judge, who wrote a memoir of his teenage alcoholism, has veered between denying the incident and saying he doesn’t recall it.) But it’s a sign of how credible Blasey seems that, since this story broke, much of the public debate has been less about whether her accusations are true than whether they are relevant.Some conservatives — though not just conservatives — insist that it is unfair to judge a middle-aged man for things he did as a kid. On Fox News, the former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer pondered the weight of high school misbehavior. “Should that deny us chances later in life?” he asked. “Even for Supreme Court job, a presidency of the United States, or you name it?”Such arguments would be more convincing if people on the right weren’t so selective in their indulgence. Donald Trump called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, who were 14 to 16 years old when they were arrested. (They’ve since been proven innocent.) Children are regularly put on sex offender registries, sometimes for their entire lives, for conduct less serious than what Kavanaugh is accused of. In a sour irony, some legal experts think Kavanaugh’s confirmation could imperil Miller v. Alabama, a 2012 decision banning life sentences without parole for most teenage convicts.Anyway, this is no longer just about what Kavanaugh might have done 36 years ago.

Opioids have been the primary driver of this calamity: first as prescription painkillers, then heroin and, more recently, illicitly manufactured fentanyl. The death toll has risen steadily over the past two decades.The Drug Enforcement Administration, the agency that most directly oversees access to opioids, deserves much of the blame for these deaths. Because of its incompetence, the opioid crisis has gone from bad to worse. The solution: overhauling the agency, or even getting rid of it entirely.The problem begins with poor design. A brainchild of Richard Nixon’s “war on drugs,” the agency sought to cut off supplies of drugs on the black market, here and abroad. But in passing the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, Congress also gave the agency broad authority over how prescription opioids and other controlled substances were classified, produced and distributed. The agency was supposed to curb problematic drug use, but failed to do so because its tactics were never informed by public health or addiction science.Despite the investment of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars and the earnest efforts of thousands of employees, the D.E.A.’s track record is abysmal. The agency has been unable to balance legitimate access to and control of prescription drugs. The widespread over-reliance on opioids, along with benzodiazepines, amphetamines and other scheduled medications, has created a booming black market."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17beletsky/17beletsky-facebookJumbo.jpge2064f6f5ddf4451835acf7eec2f6fe4	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | The Decline and Fall of New York City Ballet	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | The Decline and Fall of New York City Ballet	1	"The lawsuit adds that Mr. Finlay shared the images with a company benefactor, who wrote of wanting to “get like half a kilo” of cocaine and abuse female dancers “like farm animals” — to which Mr. Finlay allegedly responded, “or like the sluts they are.” Notably, the lawsuit also sues City Ballet itself, a first in 70 years, for fostering a “fraternity-like atmosphere.” (Mr. Finlay resigned last month.)This descent into moral vacuity has been in the works for decades. One might mark its shocking onset as when Mr. Martins was arrested on charges of beating his new wife, the ballerina Darci Kistler, in 1992. Given that Ms. Kistler was the last ballerina appointed by Mr. Balanchine — who said women “are not equal to men, they are better” — this violence had a particularly pointed symbolism.Ms. Kistler did not press charges. Mr. Martins was picked up for driving drunk a few days later in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the company of a board member (He also was convicted in early August of drunken driving in a three-car crash after several such arrests.)Despite this, the board kept Mr. Martins in his job for over 25 more years as the head of both the company and the School of American Ballet, both multimillion-dollar institutions filled with young girls and women.Mr. Martins, for the most part, refused to bring any of Mr. Balanchine’s lead dancers, his former peers, to teach at the company. Given that ballet is passed on physically, body to body, this amounted to a robbery from Mr. Martins’s own dancers of the very tradition they inherited, hastening the erosion of Mr. Balanchine’s legacy.Unsurprisingly, social media, has played its predictably insidious role at New York City Ballet. The sacred fourth wall, between audience and artist, was a necessity to our work, to making the magic. Now ballerinas tweet from the wings about their injuries and vegan muffins, amassing vast Twitter and Instagram followers, with endless selfies and self-promotion.The company’s recent ad campaigns showing bare midriffs and legs, windblown hair, and suggestive poses by slim young dancers — have used sex as a marketing tool, lowering the lure to the prurient. In that context, the Finlay scandal is no surprise. The current lawsuit with its allegations of appalling misogynistic behavior is on a continuum."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17Bentley-2/17Bentley-2-facebookJumbo.jpge26d0567bb804e6ebc0e6f8936663bc3	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | Kavanaugh and the Politics of Bad Faith	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Kavanaugh and the Politics of Bad Faith	1	"Activists in Maine opposed to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court are trying to put pressure on Susan Collins, the state’s Republican senator.

Last year, for example, major Republican donors openly threatened to withhold contributions unless the party gave them a big tax cut.But now Collins, other Republicans and conservative activists are describing the pressure over Kavanaugh as “bribery,” “extortion” and “blackmail.” And some of those claiming that normal political activism is somehow illegitimate are the very same big donors who warned Republicans to pass tax cuts or else."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17krugmanWeb/17krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg155076b7a87a40f6b4f15709a9dd1d92	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | A Dress Rehearsal for Our Deaths	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | A Dress Rehearsal for Our Deaths	1	"This Tuesday at sundown, millions of people around the world will participate in a dress rehearsal for their deaths.They will abstain from eating and drinking and making love, since corpses can do none of those things. They will utter a variation of the confessional that they will say on their death beds. And many of them will wear white, like the shrouds they will be buried in.I’ll be one of them.Most people, including many Jews, think of Yom Kippur as a 25-hour caffeine headache capped off by a lox-and-bagels binge. It’s undeniably that.But it is also, at its deepest level, a dry run. It is the one day of the year when we Jews are asked to look our mortality in the face.The words we recite on Yom Kippur make that challenge perfectly clear: “How many will pass away and how many will be born? Who will live and who will die?” The images — of God writing us in the book of life or death, of us begging for mercy and kindness, of gates closing — are so stark and, frankly, so scary that many people want to turn away.The day asks us to sustain the stare.It is a task that feels especially urgent in an era in which the “denial of death,” as Ernest Becker’s famous title had it, is so monumental that sometimes it seems as if the only real activity we are engaged in is closing our eyes to the truest fact about life: No one makes it out alive.There’s the obvious — the plastic surgery and the digital surgery and the obsession with achieving perfect quantities of tautness and plumpness and dewiness. But look through the death lens, and you’ll see our fixation on wellness and workouts in a new way. Look through the death lens, and Silicon Valley’s project to extend life indefinitely looks as foolish as Gilgamesh’s efforts to do the same. Look through the death lens, and Instagram and Twitter look like nothing more than numbing agents.I am a serial denier.I try not to be. I tell myself: You are going to die. I repeat it. I grasp it for a second or two, but then it escapes me and I’m back to before.I find that those people I know who have come closer to death are able to hold onto the truth a bit more firmly."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17Weiss-Sub/17Weiss-Sub-facebookJumbo.jpg183b8481167f47c89a703465b24babe6	[]	2018-09-16 00:00:00	Opinion | The Dangers of Digital Activism	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | The Dangers of Digital Activism	1	"Manal al-Sharif, co-founder and leader of the #Women2Drive movement and founder and CEO of Women2Hack Academy, is author of the memoir “Daring to Drive: A Saudi Woman’s Awakening.”As a Saudi Arabian woman who has lived most of her life under one of the last surviving absolute monarchies in the world, the closest I have come to experiencing democracy has been in challenging the status quo through my tweets.For activists and citizen journalists in the Arab world, social media has become a powerful way to express dissent, to disrupt and to organize.

But when it comes to matters of war and peace and to America’s place in the world, the left is either silent or confused.In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Bernie Sanders did not make foreign policy a focus. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently dismissed questions about the Israel-Palestine conflict by claiming she was “not the expert on geopolitics on this issue.” And as other candidates across the United States scramble to get votes from self-declared socialists by, say, supporting single-payer health care, few feel the need to appeal to the left on foreign policy.To be fair, there are good reasons leftists haven’t grappled much with foreign policy. For one, there are few decision makers from whom they can learn: Since the early days of the Cold War, foreign policymaking has been dominated by a bipartisan commitment to militarism and American hegemony; those who depart from the consensus view have largely been kept out of the State Department, the Pentagon and other parts of the government. At the same time, the left itself lacks institutions dedicated to developing foreign policy ideas. While Republicans and moderate Democrats have a host of think tanks pushing interventionism, no corporation or billionaire has yet decided to fund a left-wing foreign policy think tank to which politicians could turn for advice."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17bessnerWeb/17bessnerWeb-facebookJumbo.jpgbae8f2318df443ca9b8bc2221a0a8bd1	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | Trump Is Making America Great Again	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Trump Is Making America Great Again	1	"In the video above, I argue that Donald Trump is in fact making America great again — by driving us to engage in our democracy as few presidents have.

After a former colleague, Anita Hill, raised allegations of multiple instances of sexual harassment against Mr. Thomas, the senators heard from both key parties before the confirmation vote.The hearings had their flaws. Most notably, several witnesses on Ms. Hill’s side never got to testify. But the core claims were placed before the Senate before the vote.This ultimately redounded to Justice Thomas’s benefit. Now, whenever Ms. Hill’s sexual harassment allegations are raised, he or his defenders can at least say they were explored by the senators and ultimately found insufficient to deny Mr. Thomas a seat on the Supreme Court.If Mr. Kavanaugh is confirmed without further investigation of Ms. Ford’s charges, he and his defenders will not even be able to claim what Mr. Thomas’s defenders can. Judge Kavanaugh will be dogged by these accusations throughout his entire, likely decades-long service on the court. And that will lead some to question the legitimacy not just of his appointment but of the court as an institution — especially when it decides knotty social and political issues by a 5-4 vote.Considering the small number of witnesses involved — perhaps Ms. Ford, Mr. Kavanaugh, Mr. Judge, Ms. Ford’s husband and her therapist — an F.B.I. investigation followed by hearings wouldn’t take very long. The process might not be complete before the start of the Supreme Court’s new term on Oct. 1, but it should easily be able to be done before the midterm elections, if that’s the concern of Senate Republicans.The way in which Ms. Ford’s allegations came to light was, to put it charitably, deeply unfortunate. These claims should have been thoroughly and discreetly investigated weeks ago, by nonpartisan F.B.I. agents and bipartisan Senate investigators, in a way that protected Christine Ford’s privacy and Brett Kavanaugh’s good name. But here we are.It is quite possible — or even likely — that hearings won’t prevent Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed given the equivocal evidence against him and, perhaps even more important, the number of Republicans and red-state Democrats in the Senate. But due process, which ought to matter when it comes to filling the critical seat on the highest court in the land, calls for nothing less.David Lat (@davidlat), a former federal law clerk and prosecutor, is the founder of the legal news website Above the Law and author of the novel “Supreme Ambitions.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17lat2web/17lat2web-facebookJumbo.jpg9d5a94b082384d07a897d4836478a60e	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	An Avalanche of Japanese Shave Ice	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	An Avalanche of Japanese Shave Ice	1	"“It was this ginormous green spectacle that came on a tray, at least 12 inches tall, and it was very intense,” Ms. Chung recalled. “I was shocked how it kept its shape despite having all this syrup.”She compared the texture of perfect kakigori to flower petals — not quite powder and not quite grain — making it distinct from other kinds of shave ice. “It’s a simple thing that’s really hard to execute,” Ms. Chung said.Stonemill serves a traditional kakigori, ujikintoki, doused with matcha syrup and finished with a touch of sweet red bean paste. Every day, the restaurant’s pastry chef, Mikiko Yui, makes coffee jelly and soft mochi to garnish it. The cafe will keep the dessert on the menu through early October.Cha-an Teahouse has been serving ujikintoki and other kinds of kakigori in New York for more than a decade. Ms. Uematsu drew from her own experience with the sweet as well as her training as a chef to develop the white peach kakigori made from poached fruit and decorated with chewy, housemade peach gummies, cut into the shapes of stars and hearts.As he prepared to open the David Chang restaurant Majordomo in Los Angeles in January, the chef de cuisine, Marc Johnson, learned about shave-ice culture through local Korean and Taiwanese shops (cultures which also have rich histories of shave ice) as well as a popular Instagram account run by Margaret Lam.“She’d go to these kakigori competitions and jams where people would just get together and show off their craft,” said Mr. Johnson, who does not employ a pastry chef and was eager to figure out the technique.He found that the more delicate the shavings, the faster they melted. Kakigori makers often press the ice very gently with their hands, giving it a distinct rounded shape; but if packed too firmly, those soft, feathery crystals can freeze together as hard, wet clumps."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/dining/19shave2/19shave2-facebookJumbo.jpgacf1e6c1fac54233ac13061fd55fd7e1	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	‘The Eggs Were Rolling Around Every Which Way, Up and Down the Aisle’	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	‘The Eggs Were Rolling Around Every Which Way, Up and Down the Aisle’	1	"Eggs on the M86Dear Diary:I was on an M86 bus heading west toward Central Park.

And then you hold a hearing, not a trial.”____________________What both sides are sayingThere’s a lot being written about how the Senate should handle the accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh. We read through it all to break down the arguments coming from the left and the right.Liberals have almost universally called for a deeper investigation before the Senate votes to confirm. Here’s what they are saying:• A Supreme Court position is too important to hurry.“The urgency is to investigate, not to rush to confirm a lifetime appointment. Surely a few Republican senators retain enough sense of institutional responsibility to insist on that.” — Ruth Marcus, The Washington Post• Kavanaugh’s honesty is on trial.“Kavanaugh has denied that he did it … If Ford’s allegation is true, then Kavanaugh has lied to the public.” — Nathan J. Robinson, Current AffairsConservatives, meanwhile, are split. While some have echoed the same concerns as their liberal counterparts, many still believe an investigation is not warranted. Here’s what they are saying:• The allegations are too old to be proven.“There is no way to confirm her story after 35 years … This is simply too distant and uncorroborated a story to warrant a new hearing or to delay a vote.” — Wall Street Journal editorial board• The way Democrats brought the case forward is suspect.“If Kavanaugh’s confirmation is derailed, the precedent will be set. Whenever the stakes are high enough, the most sinister, underhanded forces of the left will manage to surface an unsubstantiated character-destroying allegation at the most opportune moment.” — Buck Sexton, The Hill____________________The mayor and his moneyOur colleague Alexander Burns, a national political correspondent, sends us this dispatch about how one former (and perhaps future?) politician is trying to influence this year’s elections:Michael R. Bloomberg’s plan to spend $80 million supporting Democratic congressional candidates has fueled one of the biggest guessing games in midterm politics: How’s he going to spend it? Where? For whom?Mr. Bloomberg didn’t name all of his targets in an interview, but he offered some clues.“We are looking for candidates, number one, that are good on the environment and guns in particular,” he told me. “And then candidates where we think that they have a chance, and candidates that we think aren’t guaranteed to win.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/politics/17onpolitics-pm-2/17onpolitics-pm-2-facebookJumbo.jpg56eaa69ab1374c1aa7e50dd321fa3410	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Hearing Set for Monday to Hear Kavanaugh and His Accuser	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Hearing Set for Monday to Hear Kavanaugh and His Accuser	1	"By Monday morning, however, with Dr. Blasey’s lawyer saying Dr. Blasey was willing to appear in front of Congress, Mr. McGahn and others changed course and agreed that Judge Kavanaugh should put out his statement.“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone,” the statement said. “Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.”On Capitol Hill on Monday, Mr. Grassley and Mr. McConnell initially resisted calls for hearings, and instead arranged telephone calls to allow Republican and Democratic aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey — a plan that Mr. Schumer rejected as “a biased, far-fetched process.”But by day’s end, Republican leaders concluded that it would be necessary to move forward to satisfy the concerns of senators in both parties.Still, there were other Republicans who feared the committee had made a dangerous misstep in agreeing so quickly to a public hearing. Without having fully deposed either Dr. Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh, these Republicans fear that the party and the White House could unexpectedly and irrevocably lose control of the nomination when the witnesses take the stand.Both in the letter to Ms. Feinstein and in an interview published Sunday by The Washington Post, Dr. Blasey said that during a gathering of teenagers at a private home in suburban Montgomery County, Md., the future Judge Kavanaugh, along with a friend, pushed her into a bedroom as she was making her way to a bathroom. She said the young Mr. Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, grinding his body against hers as he tried to remove her clothing. When she tried to scream, she said, he clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle the cries.“They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state,” she wrote in the letter, made public Monday by CNN. “With Kavanaugh’s hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/politics/18dc-kavanaugh-sub/18dc-kavanaugh-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg1ff3557966d44695a668f8f491af647a	[]	2018-09-16 00:00:00	Kavanaugh’s Nomination in Turmoil as Accuser Says He Assaulted Her Decades Ago	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Kavanaugh’s Nomination in Turmoil as Accuser Says He Assaulted Her Decades Ago	1	"The new revelation prompted a hurried effort by Senator Charles E.

Republicans planned to argue that unless corroborating information came to light, they had no way of verifying her story and saw no reason to delay the vote, according to a person involved in the discussions.The decision about any delay in the vote could rest on the opinions of two Republican women: Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Both are publicly undecided about Judge Kavanaugh.Ms. Collins said in an interview on Sunday night that she considered the allegations serious and that Ms. Ford needed to be personally interviewed to get a fuller account. But Ms. Collins, who could conceivably decide the outcome in the narrowly divided Senate, said Democrats had done a disservice to both Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh with their handling of the accusations.“What is puzzling to me is the Democrats, by not bringing this out earlier, after having had this information for more than six weeks, have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge,” she said. “If they believed Professor Ford, why didn’t they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didn’t believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it is was handled.”The White House, which has taken great pains to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a champion of women, sought to bolster him by pointing to statements by women who have known him and testified to his character. Those included a letter from 65 women who said that they knew him in high school and that he had “always treated women with decency and respect.”Advisers to Mr. Trump were trying to avoid publicly assailing the accuser while hoping that the lack of contemporaneous corroboration for Ms. Ford’s account would mean that Senate Republicans could move ahead without addressing it in detail."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/politics/17dc-kavanaugh/17dc-kavanaugh-facebookJumbo.jpgcadbf231334e46bd8b55558bf98618ae	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Trump Hits China With Tariffs on $200 Billion in Goods, Escalating Trade War	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Trump Hits China With Tariffs on $200 Billion in Goods, Escalating Trade War	1	"Trade analysts said Mr. Trump’s approach risked further confrontation with the Chinese.“Washington’s view seems to be that tariffs and threats of more tariffs will soften up the Chinese and make them more amenable to negotiations,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist who specializes in trade issues. “The evidence that, in response to U.S. bullying tactics, China just stiffens its spine and strikes back with proportionate tariffs against U.S. imports has had no discernible effect on the Trump administration’s take-no-prisoners approach to this rapidly escalating trade war.”China is expected to further retaliate against the United States, and top officials have warned that could include penalizing American companies that rely on Chinese components for phones, cars, televisions and other products. China’s commerce ministry has said that it is ready to put similar tariffs on $60 billion a year of American goods in response to the threat from the United States. China has matched previous tariff moves dollar for dollar, but the number of American goods to tax is dwindling because, for many years, it has only imported about a quarter as much as it exports to the United States.Lou Jiwei, China’s finance minister until his recent retirement and now a senior Communist Party adviser, delivered an unexpectedly strong threat to the United States in a lunch speech at the forum, which is organized by a government agency reporting directly to the cabinet. Mr. Lou said that, if necessary in the trade war, China could halt exports to the United States of components that are crucial to American companies’ supply chains.Mr. Lou said that it would take years for American companies to find alternatives to China. “To take a step back, the United States can establish an alternative supply chain in a third country, but it takes time — what about the pain of three to five years? This is enough to cross a political cycle,” he said.American businesses — which have warned that tariffs could hurt profits, force job cuts and, in some cases, destroy companies, said the taxes were going to hurt the United States more than the administration realized. The National Association of Chemical Distributors released a study this month that predicted nearly 28,000 chemical distributor and supplier jobs would be eliminated because of higher prices from the $200 billion round of tariffs.“These tariffs are going to be paid for by the working families who drive our economy,” said Jonathan Gold, a spokesman for a business group formed to fight tariffs called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland. “Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. By choosing to unilaterally raise taxes on Americans, the cost of running a farm, factory or business will grow. In many cases, these costs will be passed on to American families.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/business/00dc-chinatariffs-1/00dc-chinatariffs-1-facebookJumbo.jpg7cee870ae26549a1bf16c44ae856a68d	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Trump Says Tariffs Will Save American Factories. History Shows Otherwise.	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Trump Says Tariffs Will Save American Factories. History Shows Otherwise.	1	"WASHINGTON — President Trump is building a wall of tariffs around the domestic economy, attempting to protect American jobs by limiting imports. But a tire factory that opened last year in Richburg, S.C., offers a reminder that globalization is hard to stop.In 2009, American tire makers persuaded the Obama administration to impose tariffs on Chinese tires, and imports of tires from China fell sharply. But Chinese companies did not stop making tires in response to the tariffs — they simply moved production to other places, including to the United States.Giti, one of the largest tire makers in China, built the South Carolina factory to make low-cost tires for Walmart. Two other Chinese tire companies are building plants in the neighboring states of Georgia and North Carolina, and a fourth Chinese company acquired a tire factory in Georgia this year.Mr. Trump on Monday said the United States would begin imposing tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 24, on top of the $50 billion worth of products he previously taxed. The new tariffs hit many of the consumer products that Americans use every day, like food, clothing and electronics, and the president threatened to go even further, saying he is prepared to tax all Chinese imports if Beijing retaliates."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/17dc-tariffs1/17dc-tariffs-facebookJumbo.jpg60b6830dd9c74366ac53c4cd5a5e0a73	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Florence Live Updates: Rivers Still Rising as Storm Pushes Away	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Florence Live Updates: Rivers Still Rising as Storm Pushes Away	1	"WILMINGTON, N.C. — Emergency workers rushed into beleaguered cities across the Carolinas on Monday as residents struggled with the aftermath of a storm that drenched the region with record rainfall, damaged tens of thousands of homes and delivered floodwaters that may not recede for days.Even as the remnants of Hurricane Florence pulled away, it was clear that the turmoil had only begun.Wilmington, one of North Carolina’s most populous cities, was virtually cut off. Floodwaters pushed ever higher in some communities as the rains flowed into rivers and rushed downstream.The authorities in North and South Carolina rescued more people by air and water.

Ms. Monk had been in a family shelter in Columbia, S.C., that ground down her soul, she said. At Trent Court, she could gaze out her front door onto the wide, rippling river. She could take in its breeze, its smell, its changing colors and moods.This week, after a brief evacuation, she returned to Trent Court to find that flooding from Florence had turned her place into a sodden wreck. She also realized that she was now a player in the kind of redevelopment drama that tends to swamp storm-battered places like this — a story of race, class, gentrification and safety fears, and questions without easy answers about who gets to live on often alluring, sometimes treacherous, waterside real estate."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/18newbern-02/18newbern-02-facebookJumbo.jpg0184470c78294066afd7ff037cd1c036	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Trump to Cap Refugees Allowed Into U.S. at 30,000, a Record Low	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Trump to Cap Refugees Allowed Into U.S. at 30,000, a Record Low	1	"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to cap the number of refugees that can be resettled in the United States next year at 30,000, his administration announced on Monday, further cutting an already drastically scaled-back program that offers protection to foreigners fleeing violence and persecution.Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, announced the limit at the State Department, saying it reflected the “daunting operational reality” of addressing what he called a “humanitarian crisis” involving people claiming asylum in the United States.The number represents the lowest ceiling a president has placed on the refugee program since its creation in 1980, and a reduction of a third from the 45,000-person limit that Mr. Trump set for 2018.The move is the latest in a series of efforts the president has made to clamp down on immigration to the United States."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/politics/18dc-refugees-1/18dc-refugees-1-facebookJumbo.jpg0cb8b1d1833f42a9ba1776d744558afe	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Bloomberg May Run for President as a Democrat. Some of His Views May Cause Him Trouble.	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Bloomberg May Run for President as a Democrat. Some of His Views May Cause Him Trouble.	1	"In the interview Friday — his first extended comments on his thinking about a 2020 presidential run — Mr. Bloomberg expressed stubbornly contrary views on those fronts. He criticized liberal Democrats’ attitude toward big business, endorsing certain financial regulations but singling out a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to break up Wall Street banks as wrongheaded. He also defended his mayoral administration’s policy of stopping people on the street to search them for guns, a police tactic that predominantly affected black and Latino men, as a necessary expedient against crime.And while Mr. Bloomberg expressed concern about allegations of sexual misconduct that have arisen in the last year, he also voiced doubt about some of them and said only a court could determine their veracity. He gave as an example Charlie Rose, the disgraced television anchor who for years broadcast his eponymous talk show from the offices of Mr. Bloomberg’s company.“The stuff I read about is disgraceful — I don’t know how true all of it is,” Mr. Bloomberg said of the #MeToo movement. Raising Mr. Rose unprompted, he said: “We never had a complaint, whatsoever, and when I read some of the stuff, I was surprised, I will say. But I never saw anything and we have no record, we’ve checked very carefully.”Mr. Bloomberg said the media industry was guilty of not “standing up” against sexual misconduct sooner, but declined to say whether he believed the allegations against Mr. Rose. “Let the court system decide,” he said, while acknowledging that the claims involving Mr. Rose might never be adjudicated in a legal proceeding.Mr. Rose, 76, has been accused by numerous women of unwanted and coercive sexual behavior, including claims that he groped female subordinates and exposed himself to them. He was fired by both CBS, where he hosted a morning show, and PBS, which broadcast the program “Charlie Rose,” which Mr. Rose recorded in the Bloomberg office. Bloomberg TV also terminated an arrangement that allowed it to rebroadcast Mr. Rose’s show.“You know, is it true?” Mr. Bloomberg said of the allegations. “You look at people that say it is, but we have a system where you have — presumption of innocence is the basis of it.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/18bloomberg1/18bloomberg1-facebookJumbo.jpg3c03fa349de34feba573487c18da7f9a	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Ted Cruz’s Campaign Marked a Fund-Raising Letter an Official ‘Summons.’ It Wasn’t Against the Rules.	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Ted Cruz’s Campaign Marked a Fund-Raising Letter an Official ‘Summons.’ It Wasn’t Against the Rules.	1	"Ted Cruz’s Senate re-election campaign has been sending voters in Texas a fund-raising letter in an envelope labeled “summons enclosed,” drawing criticism from some who called it misleading and raising questions about whether such a practice was legal. It is.That is according to Myles Martin, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, who said the salient question was whether a mailing contains a disclaimer saying that it came from a political campaign. And this one did.Aside from that, he said in an email, “the F.E.C.’s regulations don’t speak to how candidates may choose to word particular solicitations to potential contributors.”Mr. Cruz is locked in an unexpectedly tight race against Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso, in a traditionally conservative state. Earlier this month, a top adviser to President Trump, Mick Mulvaney, the federal budget director, told a gathering of donors he believed it was possible Mr. Cruz might not win re-election because he is not “likable.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/politics/18cruzmail2/18cruzmail2-facebookJumbo.jpg717705c50a8e4cf5b2fccfd66f4f8606	['John Koblin']	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Emmys 2018 Live Updates: A Marriage Proposal Onstage	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Emmys 2018 Live Updates: A Marriage Proposal Onstage	1	"While both are favorites, they have their vulnerabilities. The most recent episode of “Thrones” aired 13 months ago, which may have left Emmy voters trying to recall what happened in its long-ago seventh season. And many supporters of “Handmaid’s” — who have propelled the series into a red-cloaked cultural landmark — had mixed feelings about its second-season finale.PhotoThe plausible challengers for the best drama statuette are “The Americans,” the FX show about Russian spies, and Netflix’s sweeping study of Queen Elizabeth, “The Crown.”[Stream these 10 Emmy nominated shows you may not have seen.]The FX drama, which completed its six-season run in May, has won only two Emmys, but it has long been a critical favorite. And Emmy voters have been known to shower love on a show on its way out, as they did for “The Sopranos” and “Breaking Bad.”“The Crown,” meanwhile, won best cast in a drama at the Creative Arts Emmys a week ago, an occasional bellwether; four of the past eight best drama winners also won for best cast. Because the series will bring aboard new cast members every few years, this is also a last chance for Emmy voters to recognize the iteration of the show starring Claire Foy, who will cede the role of the queen to Olivia Colman as the show moves into the mid-1960s.Lorne Michaels and the ‘S.N.L.’ EffectPhotoLorne Michaels, the 73-year-old impresario behind “Saturday Night Live” and NBC’s late-night lineup, is producing the show for the second time, having last overseen the broadcast in 1988, when the “Dynasty” star John Forsythe was the host.NBC hoped that the hosts, Colin Jost and Michael Che, the anchors of Weekend Update on “S.N.L.,” would help reverse a trend of plummeting awards show ratings.In addition to giving the hosting job to Mr. Jost and Mr. Che, Mr. Michaels recruited a number of current and former “S.N.L.” cast members. The show began with a musical spoof live on stage about how Hollywood’s diversity problems are all history. “Yup, we solved it!” exclaimed Kenan Thompson, who was joined on stage beside Kate McKinnon, RuPaul and Andy Samberg, among others.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIn a way, it has been surprising to see the New York-based “S.N.L.” front and center at the Emmys. The Television Academy, the main body behind the awards, has looked askance at the show for most of its 43-year run.But that has changed, with “S.N.L.” having won nearly half of its 61 Emmys in the past five years. Last year, it won the best variety sketch Emmy, the first time it had claimed a top show award since 1993.Although many critics felt that “S.N.L.” had an off year this past season, it is nevertheless still scoring: After last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys, it is tied for first with “Game of Thrones” among all TV shows, with seven wins. Those include Tiffany Haddish for best guest actress in a comedy and Don Roy King for directing.‘Mrs. Maisel’ wins big in comedyPhotoAmazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” about a comedian in 1950s New York, got off to a huge start, winning four awards.Rachel Brosnahan won the Emmy for best actress in a comedy, the first new winner in that category in seven years. (With HBO’s “Veep” sidelined this year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus hit the pause button on her record-breaking Emmy run.) The show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, won two Emmys, one for directing and one for writing. And Alex Borstein, who plays Mrs. Maisel’s manager, won for best supporting actress.The triumph of “Mrs. Maisel” was a blow to the avant-garde FX comedy “Atlanta,” which was snubbed. Donald Glover, the show’s star and creator, took the prize for best actor in a comedy last year. This time, he lost out to Bill Hader, who plays a hit man trying to make it as an actor in “Barry.”In another win for “Barry,” Henry Winkler, 72, won his first Emmy for his role as a well-intentioned but cheesy acting coach. Mr. Winkler, who attained network stardom in the 1970s playing Fonzie on the ABC sitcom “Happy Days,” had been nominated five times before. Before thanking his co-workers and family members, he noted that he had written his acceptance speech “43 years ago.”In the late-night battle, John Oliver’s weekly HBO show, “Last Week Tonight,” seems poised to take the best variety talk category for a third year in a row. But last year’s Emmys host, Stephen Colbert, the host of “The Late Show” on CBS, is still surging in the ratings, giving him the potential to topple his former Comedy Central colleague.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyExpect #MeToo to have a big roleIn the last year, many TV stars, including Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K. and Mark Halperin have been forced out after facing allegations of sexual misconduct. Earlier this month, the #MeToo movement reached into the corporate side of the business, when multiple accusations of sexual misconduct led to the ouster of the CBS president and chief executive Leslie Moonves.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Tonight’s Emmys show is the first one to be broadcast since the first investigative article on accusations against Harvey Weinstein was published in The New York Times last October, meaning that it presents the first opportunity for the television industry at this ceremony.Mr. Che introduced himself by welcoming “the many, many talented people in Hollywood who haven’t been caught yet.”Invocations of Mr. Trump were never far from the lips of Emmy hosts and winners during the last two broadcasts. While hosting the 2016 edition of the show, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel called out Mark Burnett, the prolific reality show producer who produced Mr. Trump in “The Apprentice,” saying he would be the man to blame if Mr. Trump won. And at last year’s Emmys, at virtually every turn, Mr. Colbert and a number of the winners got in on the act of criticizing the president.In recent years, Mr. Trump’s presence has overwhelmed this ceremony, but winners and hosts have taken a break so far from bashing the president this year. Mr. Che and Mr. Jost never used his name in their opening remarks. And most winners, like Ms. Brosnahan, have stayed away from third rail political fare, instead encouraging viewers to “show up and vote” at this year’s midterm elections.It’s Netflix versus HBOIt’s the battle of bragging rights.During last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys, HBO put 17 Emmys on the scoreboard. Netflix was right behind, with 16. Executives from both companies will be fidgeting in their seats as they watch for the outcome of a contest that may mean more to the television industry than it does to viewers.HBO has won the most Emmys of any network each year since 2002. But in a sign that the jewel of cable may not dominate the ceremony for much longer, Netflix snapped HBO’s 17-year streak of leading all competitors in Emmy nominations earlier this summer.PhotoThere will be 26 awards handed out during Monday’s ceremony, a total that is slightly greater than the number of categories on the Oscar and Golden Globe broadcasts. Last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmys gave golden statuettes to winners in nearly 100 categories.But the supersize nature of the Emmys is a reflection of where television is these days, now that streaming companies like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are taking up more of viewers’ time and challenging the industry’s old economic model. By year’s end, there will have been more than 500 scripted shows produced by United States-based broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, which will set yet another record.As a result, Emmy campaigning has grown more intense. So-called For Your Consideration events — panel discussions where voters have access to stars, canapés and booze — have filled the schedules of the more than 23,000 members of the Television Academy in the run-up to the 70th edition of the show. Last year, there were 61 academy-sanctioned events in Los Angeles and New York during Emmy campaigning season. This year, that number ballooned to 116, according to a spokesman for the academy."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/arts/18emmys-hp-slide-1J25/18emmys-hp-slide-1J25-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg28a66e506e8f453c9e8ba31fa938daff	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	2018 Emmy Winners List	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	2018 Emmy Winners List	1	"These are the major winners of the 70th annual Primetime Emmy Awards.

She serves on the board of several organizations and was a co-founder in 2011 of a short-term residential community for homeless families in San Francisco. She declined to be interviewed.The hands-off policy might not last, given the deep gloom over physical magazines.“Marc Benioff is a guy who wants whatever he touches to succeed,” said Phil Bronstein, a longtime Bay Area newsman. “If that’s going to require him to be involved, he’ll do it.”Mr. Benioff is deeply embedded in the Bay Area. His grandfather helped build the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, and his father ran a chain of clothing stores in the city. He began writing software as a teenager and briefly wrote code in the mid-1980s at Apple during the original tenure of Steve Jobs. But he first broke into prominence during a 13-year stint at Oracle, a dominant supplier of databases and other software. There Mr. Benioff was schooled in sales and strategy by one of Silicon Valley’s most brash leaders, Larry Ellison.Mr. Benioff, though he calls Mr. Ellison his mentor, broke from Oracle’s practices in significant ways when he started Salesforce. His start-up, founded in an apartment on San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill in 1999, opted not to sell software that customers would install on their own computers. Rather, Salesforce ran its offerings — which initially automated sales tasks like tracking customer histories — on its own computers and delivered them to corporations over the internet.This strategy reduced technical expenses and headaches for customers, while allowing Salesforce to make initial sales to small groups of employees at companies that would expand over time.It was a risky bet, because the web could be unreliable. But what would later be called a “cloud” model gradually became the dominant way for start-ups to deliver software. Even Mr. Ellison, who once derided the term, was an early investor in Salesforce and has turned Oracle into a major supplier of cloud-based offerings."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/business/18benioff-silo/merlin_136625550_5781b17c-7536-42a0-a655-f1bc63f18b3c-facebookJumbo.jpg6a6657d2d1c74823b9668216f18eb5bb	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	After Fetching a High Price, Time Magazine Moves Into a New Era	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	After Fetching a High Price, Time Magazine Moves Into a New Era	1	"Mr. Benioff is the latest tech billionaire to take the reins of a historic news brand. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013, and last year, Laurene Powell Jobs, who heads the Emerson Collective and is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, bought a majority stake of The Atlantic magazine.Media outlets have also become attractive to billionaires focused on philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Benioff has spoken out on the gender pay gap and protested an Indiana law that critics said discriminated against people who are gay or transgender. He said he would stay away from Time’s editorial decisions.But the re-emergence of billionaire media proprietors isn’t a sign the news profession is bouncing back, said Kyle Pope, the editor in chief of the Columbia Journalism Review.“Let’s not read anything more into this about the health of newsmagazines,” he said. “Most papers and magazines across the country are still desperate.”He added: “Iconic magazines like Time will always have a suitor because people like Benioff will always want to own these things. It's a good way to keep these titles going, but it doesn’t seem like it’s good for journalism writ large.”With Time, Mr. Benioff and his wife will face challenges. The magazine’s revenue inched past $170 million last year with profits around $25 million, according to two of the people familiar with its finances.Expenses at Meredith’s magazine division grew by more than $566 million with the addition of Time Inc., while profits shrank by more than a third to $98 million in the 12 months ending in June, when the company reports its fiscal year."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/business/18TIMEINC-top/18TIMEINC-top-facebookJumbo.jpg3876c491a1a64d609946a778e1b33a3d	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | #BrettToo?	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | #BrettToo?	1	"What happened between two teenagers at a suburban Maryland house party on a night more than three decades ago? Since one of them has been identified by the other as Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge who is now up for a seat on the United States Supreme Court, the Senate correctly decided to hear from Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser next week before proceeding with his confirmation.The accusations are detailed and appalling. Christine Blasey Ford, now a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, says she was 15 years old on the night in question when a “highly inebriated” Brett Kavanaugh, then 17, pushed her into a bedroom, locked the door and turned on loud music to mask her cries for help. She says he climbed on top of her, held a hand over her mouth and tried to take her clothes off. “I feared he may inadvertently kill me,” Dr. Blasey wrote in a July letter for her congresswoman to pass along to Senator Dianne Feinstein.Judge Kavanaugh has flatly denied any wrongdoing. “I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” he said in a statement.This is the sort of denial that an innocent man would offer. It is also increasingly the modus operandi in the age of Donald Trump, regardless of the accusations at hand: Don’t engage with the specifics, just deny, deny, deny."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17kavanaugh/merlin_143888694_028adfa7-266a-4720-acaa-2772b999d710-facebookJumbo.jpgf078065dec384c30a7cbfd586669b96a	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | Boys Will Be Supreme Court Justices	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Boys Will Be Supreme Court Justices	1	"Kavanaugh denies the allegation unequivocally; on Monday he said he’s willing to rebut it before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Judge, who wrote a memoir of his teenage alcoholism, has veered between denying the incident and saying he doesn’t recall it.) But it’s a sign of how credible Blasey seems that, since this story broke, much of the public debate has been less about whether her accusations are true than whether they are relevant.Some conservatives — though not just conservatives — insist that it is unfair to judge a middle-aged man for things he did as a kid. On Fox News, the former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer pondered the weight of high school misbehavior. “Should that deny us chances later in life?” he asked. “Even for Supreme Court job, a presidency of the United States, or you name it?”Such arguments would be more convincing if people on the right weren’t so selective in their indulgence. Donald Trump called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, who were 14 to 16 years old when they were arrested. (They’ve since been proven innocent.) Children are regularly put on sex offender registries, sometimes for their entire lives, for conduct less serious than what Kavanaugh is accused of. In a sour irony, some legal experts think Kavanaugh’s confirmation could imperil Miller v. Alabama, a 2012 decision banning life sentences without parole for most teenage convicts.Anyway, this is no longer just about what Kavanaugh might have done 36 years ago. We need to determine, as best we can, if he’s lying now. The Judiciary Committee will be able to begin trying to do that at a public hearing next Monday — called by the committee's head, Charles Grassley, under pressure from some members of his own party.Senators should also demand that Kavanaugh’s old friend Judge, who grew up to become a right-wing writer, testify, though Kavanaugh would surely prefer other character witnesses. (“Oh for the days when President George W. Bush gave his wife, Laura, a loving but firm pat on the backside in public,” Judge once wrote. “The man knew who was boss.”)"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17goldbergWeb/17goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg0efb1b27b40a41ee877fb16b0ebab2cd	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | The Federal Agency That Fuels the Opioid Crisis	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | The Federal Agency That Fuels the Opioid Crisis	1	"Every day, nearly 200 people across the country die from drug overdoses. Opioids have been the primary driver of this calamity: first as prescription painkillers, then heroin and, more recently, illicitly manufactured fentanyl. The death toll has risen steadily over the past two decades.The Drug Enforcement Administration, the agency that most directly oversees access to opioids, deserves much of the blame for these deaths. Because of its incompetence, the opioid crisis has gone from bad to worse. The solution: overhauling the agency, or even getting rid of it entirely.The problem begins with poor design. A brainchild of Richard Nixon’s “war on drugs,” the agency sought to cut off supplies of drugs on the black market, here and abroad. But in passing the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, Congress also gave the agency broad authority over how prescription opioids and other controlled substances were classified, produced and distributed. The agency was supposed to curb problematic drug use, but failed to do so because its tactics were never informed by public health or addiction science.Despite the investment of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars and the earnest efforts of thousands of employees, the D.E.A.’s track record is abysmal. The agency has been unable to balance legitimate access to and control of prescription drugs. The widespread over-reliance on opioids, along with benzodiazepines, amphetamines and other scheduled medications, has created a booming black market."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17beletsky/17beletsky-facebookJumbo.jpg2aae8c6f0e0845cf8fc527031417b3c1	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | The Decline and Fall of New York City Ballet	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | The Decline and Fall of New York City Ballet	1	"The lawsuit adds that Mr. Finlay shared the images with a company benefactor, who wrote of wanting to “get like half a kilo” of cocaine and abuse female dancers “like farm animals” — to which Mr. Finlay allegedly responded, “or like the sluts they are.” Notably, the lawsuit also sues City Ballet itself, a first in 70 years, for fostering a “fraternity-like atmosphere.” (Mr. Finlay resigned last month.)This descent into moral vacuity has been in the works for decades. One might mark its shocking onset as when Mr. Martins was arrested on charges of beating his new wife, the ballerina Darci Kistler, in 1992. Given that Ms. Kistler was the last ballerina appointed by Mr. Balanchine — who said women “are not equal to men, they are better” — this violence had a particularly pointed symbolism.Ms. Kistler did not press charges. Mr. Martins was picked up for driving drunk a few days later in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the company of a board member (He also was convicted in early August of drunken driving in a three-car crash after several such arrests.)Despite this, the board kept Mr. Martins in his job for over 25 more years as the head of both the company and the School of American Ballet, both multimillion-dollar institutions filled with young girls and women.Mr. Martins, for the most part, refused to bring any of Mr. Balanchine’s lead dancers, his former peers, to teach at the company. Given that ballet is passed on physically, body to body, this amounted to a robbery from Mr. Martins’s own dancers of the very tradition they inherited, hastening the erosion of Mr. Balanchine’s legacy.Unsurprisingly, social media, has played its predictably insidious role at New York City Ballet. The sacred fourth wall, between audience and artist, was a necessity to our work, to making the magic. Now ballerinas tweet from the wings about their injuries and vegan muffins, amassing vast Twitter and Instagram followers, with endless selfies and self-promotion.The company’s recent ad campaigns showing bare midriffs and legs, windblown hair, and suggestive poses by slim young dancers — have used sex as a marketing tool, lowering the lure to the prurient. In that context, the Finlay scandal is no surprise. The current lawsuit with its allegations of appalling misogynistic behavior is on a continuum."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17Bentley-2/17Bentley-2-facebookJumbo.jpgbeb3dabe649d4fdea1ef63c3066d33df	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | Kavanaugh and the Politics of Bad Faith	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Kavanaugh and the Politics of Bad Faith	1	"Activists in Maine opposed to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court are trying to put pressure on Susan Collins, the state’s Republican senator. If Collins votes for Kavanaugh, they say, they will donate substantial sums to her opponent in the next election.Whatever you think of Kavanaugh, this is surely a legitimate tactic: Donors and activists try to influence politicians’ votes all the time, often by warning of adverse electoral consequences if the politicians make what the activists consider the wrong choice. Last year, for example, major Republican donors openly threatened to withhold contributions unless the party gave them a big tax cut.But now Collins, other Republicans and conservative activists are describing the pressure over Kavanaugh as “bribery,” “extortion” and “blackmail.” And some of those claiming that normal political activism is somehow illegitimate are the very same big donors who warned Republicans to pass tax cuts or else."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17krugmanWeb/17krugmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpgdf734155d5d5410db7bd4c0fb1973745	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | A Dress Rehearsal for Our Deaths	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | A Dress Rehearsal for Our Deaths	1	"This Tuesday at sundown, millions of people around the world will participate in a dress rehearsal for their deaths.They will abstain from eating and drinking and making love, since corpses can do none of those things. They will utter a variation of the confessional that they will say on their death beds. And many of them will wear white, like the shrouds they will be buried in.I’ll be one of them.Most people, including many Jews, think of Yom Kippur as a 25-hour caffeine headache capped off by a lox-and-bagels binge. It’s undeniably that.But it is also, at its deepest level, a dry run. It is the one day of the year when we Jews are asked to look our mortality in the face.The words we recite on Yom Kippur make that challenge perfectly clear: “How many will pass away and how many will be born? Who will live and who will die?” The images — of God writing us in the book of life or death, of us begging for mercy and kindness, of gates closing — are so stark and, frankly, so scary that many people want to turn away.The day asks us to sustain the stare.It is a task that feels especially urgent in an era in which the “denial of death,” as Ernest Becker’s famous title had it, is so monumental that sometimes it seems as if the only real activity we are engaged in is closing our eyes to the truest fact about life: No one makes it out alive.There’s the obvious — the plastic surgery and the digital surgery and the obsession with achieving perfect quantities of tautness and plumpness and dewiness. But look through the death lens, and you’ll see our fixation on wellness and workouts in a new way. Look through the death lens, and Silicon Valley’s project to extend life indefinitely looks as foolish as Gilgamesh’s efforts to do the same. Look through the death lens, and Instagram and Twitter look like nothing more than numbing agents.I am a serial denier.I try not to be. I tell myself: You are going to die. I repeat it. I grasp it for a second or two, but then it escapes me and I’m back to before.I find that those people I know who have come closer to death are able to hold onto the truth a bit more firmly."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17Weiss-Sub/17Weiss-Sub-facebookJumbo.jpg91bb402a7f314b44b192379f98282a0f	[]	2018-09-16 00:00:00	Opinion | The Dangers of Digital Activism	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | The Dangers of Digital Activism	1	"Manal al-Sharif, co-founder and leader of the #Women2Drive movement and founder and CEO of Women2Hack Academy, is author of the memoir “Daring to Drive: A Saudi Woman’s Awakening.”As a Saudi Arabian woman who has lived most of her life under one of the last surviving absolute monarchies in the world, the closest I have come to experiencing democracy has been in challenging the status quo through my tweets.For activists and citizen journalists in the Arab world, social media has become a powerful way to express dissent, to disrupt and to organize. Digital activism, however, comes at a high price: The very tools we use for our cause can be — and have been — used to undermine us.While social media platforms were designed as a way to connect people online, activists used them as technological tools of liberation, devising creative hacks to defy state censorship, connect with like-minded people, mobilize the masses, influence public opinion, push for social change and ignite revolutions. With these opportunities came risks: The more we posted and engaged, the more vulnerable we became, as our aggregated data was weaponized against us. Over time, such data can be used to build an accurate picture not only of users’ preferences, likes and behaviors, but also of their beliefs, political views and intimate personal details; things that even their family and friends may not know about them."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17WR-ALSHARIF/17WR-ALSHARIF-facebookJumbo.jpg9e7f23f52708450ebcf67d14399ef073	[]	2018-09-15 00:00:00	Opinion | Netflix Morning Meeting	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Netflix Morning Meeting	1	"Netflix plans to spend about $8 billion this year on original television.

But when it comes to matters of war and peace and to America’s place in the world, the left is either silent or confused.In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Bernie Sanders did not make foreign policy a focus. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently dismissed questions about the Israel-Palestine conflict by claiming she was “not the expert on geopolitics on this issue.” And as other candidates across the United States scramble to get votes from self-declared socialists by, say, supporting single-payer health care, few feel the need to appeal to the left on foreign policy.To be fair, there are good reasons leftists haven’t grappled much with foreign policy. For one, there are few decision makers from whom they can learn: Since the early days of the Cold War, foreign policymaking has been dominated by a bipartisan commitment to militarism and American hegemony; those who depart from the consensus view have largely been kept out of the State Department, the Pentagon and other parts of the government. At the same time, the left itself lacks institutions dedicated to developing foreign policy ideas. While Republicans and moderate Democrats have a host of think tanks pushing interventionism, no corporation or billionaire has yet decided to fund a left-wing foreign policy think tank to which politicians could turn for advice."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17bessnerWeb/17bessnerWeb-facebookJumbo.jpga105d112f8554dd087dbf57d19324787	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Opinion | Trump Is Making America Great Again	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Opinion | Trump Is Making America Great Again	1	"In the video above, I argue that Donald Trump is in fact making America great again — by driving us to engage in our democracy as few presidents have.

After a former colleague, Anita Hill, raised allegations of multiple instances of sexual harassment against Mr. Thomas, the senators heard from both key parties before the confirmation vote.The hearings had their flaws. Most notably, several witnesses on Ms. Hill’s side never got to testify. But the core claims were placed before the Senate before the vote.This ultimately redounded to Justice Thomas’s benefit. Now, whenever Ms. Hill’s sexual harassment allegations are raised, he or his defenders can at least say they were explored by the senators and ultimately found insufficient to deny Mr. Thomas a seat on the Supreme Court.If Mr. Kavanaugh is confirmed without further investigation of Ms. Ford’s charges, he and his defenders will not even be able to claim what Mr. Thomas’s defenders can. Judge Kavanaugh will be dogged by these accusations throughout his entire, likely decades-long service on the court. And that will lead some to question the legitimacy not just of his appointment but of the court as an institution — especially when it decides knotty social and political issues by a 5-4 vote.Considering the small number of witnesses involved — perhaps Ms. Ford, Mr. Kavanaugh, Mr. Judge, Ms. Ford’s husband and her therapist — an F.B.I. investigation followed by hearings wouldn’t take very long. The process might not be complete before the start of the Supreme Court’s new term on Oct. 1, but it should easily be able to be done before the midterm elections, if that’s the concern of Senate Republicans.The way in which Ms. Ford’s allegations came to light was, to put it charitably, deeply unfortunate. These claims should have been thoroughly and discreetly investigated weeks ago, by nonpartisan F.B.I. agents and bipartisan Senate investigators, in a way that protected Christine Ford’s privacy and Brett Kavanaugh’s good name. But here we are.It is quite possible — or even likely — that hearings won’t prevent Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed given the equivocal evidence against him and, perhaps even more important, the number of Republicans and red-state Democrats in the Senate. But due process, which ought to matter when it comes to filling the critical seat on the highest court in the land, calls for nothing less.David Lat (@davidlat), a former federal law clerk and prosecutor, is the founder of the legal news website Above the Law and author of the novel “Supreme Ambitions.”"	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17lat2web/17lat2web-facebookJumbo.jpg376636039744448292c59892788ba1c1	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	An Avalanche of Japanese Shave Ice	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	An Avalanche of Japanese Shave Ice	1	"“It was this ginormous green spectacle that came on a tray, at least 12 inches tall, and it was very intense,” Ms. Chung recalled. “I was shocked how it kept its shape despite having all this syrup.”She compared the texture of perfect kakigori to flower petals — not quite powder and not quite grain — making it distinct from other kinds of shave ice. “It’s a simple thing that’s really hard to execute,” Ms. Chung said.Stonemill serves a traditional kakigori, ujikintoki, doused with matcha syrup and finished with a touch of sweet red bean paste. Every day, the restaurant’s pastry chef, Mikiko Yui, makes coffee jelly and soft mochi to garnish it. The cafe will keep the dessert on the menu through early October.Cha-an Teahouse has been serving ujikintoki and other kinds of kakigori in New York for more than a decade. Ms. Uematsu drew from her own experience with the sweet as well as her training as a chef to develop the white peach kakigori made from poached fruit and decorated with chewy, housemade peach gummies, cut into the shapes of stars and hearts.As he prepared to open the David Chang restaurant Majordomo in Los Angeles in January, the chef de cuisine, Marc Johnson, learned about shave-ice culture through local Korean and Taiwanese shops (cultures which also have rich histories of shave ice) as well as a popular Instagram account run by Margaret Lam.“She’d go to these kakigori competitions and jams where people would just get together and show off their craft,” said Mr. Johnson, who does not employ a pastry chef and was eager to figure out the technique.He found that the more delicate the shavings, the faster they melted. Kakigori makers often press the ice very gently with their hands, giving it a distinct rounded shape; but if packed too firmly, those soft, feathery crystals can freeze together as hard, wet clumps."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/dining/19shave2/19shave2-facebookJumbo.jpge41dec4f1e3143b9a9731a0e8f48e61d	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	‘The Eggs Were Rolling Around Every Which Way, Up and Down the Aisle’	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	‘The Eggs Were Rolling Around Every Which Way, Up and Down the Aisle’	1	"Eggs on the M86Dear Diary:I was on an M86 bus heading west toward Central Park.

By soaking the raw fries in cold water, you remove some of the starch, a technique I recommend for other interesting preparations in which you want the vegetal rather than the starchy component of the potato. (Try soaking potatoes in several turns of fresh, cold water and then stir-frying in a blistering wok with Sichuan peppercorns someday. Massively addictive!) Once destarched, the perfect French fry concept is straightforward, if laborious. As with making the best home fries, you want to start with an already-cooked potato. The interesting deviation here is that you parcook the potatoes in acidulated water first, give them a second blanching in hot oil and then freeze the fries at this stage. Once frozen, they are yours to cherish for months at whim — ready your clean, hot fry oil and sizzle away.Featured in: Spoil Them A Little With Homemade French Fries."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/magazine/16mag-eat/16mag-eat-threeByTwoMediumAt2X.png618a4b2144fb45be96514041603667a9	['David Tanis', 'Tara Parker-Pope', 'Mark Bittman', 'Melissa Clark', 'Florence Fabricant', 'Erin Jeanne Mcdowell', 'Julia Moskin', 'Hannah Kirshner', 'Marian Burros', 'Genevieve Ko']		Summer Pasta With Zucchini, Ricotta and Basil Recipe	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	Summer Pasta With Zucchini, Ricotta and Basil Recipe	1	"Log InSuccess!This is now saved to your Recipe Box.

For example, you can cook pork ribs in the pot until they’re falling apart tender, then broil them to crisp the edges.Quick Sautéed Food: Anything that you can sauté in a pan on the stovetop in under 15 minutes (small pieces of meat like cutlets, delicate vegetables and fruits, certain egg dishes, pasta) will do better on the stove – particularly if you are looking for browning or caramelization. You also won’t save any time, even if you’re using the pressure cooking setting. By the time you bring everything up to pressure, allow for the cooking time and then release the pressure, it will probably take at least 15 minutes. So if you can do it faster and better on the stove, you might as well.Rare Steaks and Other Meats: Save these for the grill, a cast-iron pan on the stove top, or the broiler.Fish and Seafood: Because they can go from done to overdone in a matter of seconds, most fish and seafood do better using methods other than the pressure setting. You can get a great result from pressure cooking, but your margin of error is pretty small. Always follow the recipe exactly for the first time when cooking fish, or err on the side of less time. Generally, low pressure is sufficient, rather than using high pressure. Slow cooking, on the other hand, can work really well with fish and seafood, especially for seafood stews, braises, and steamed mussels and other bivalves.Pasta: You can cook pasta in the multicooker, but it’s not nearly as intuitive or easy as boiling it on the stove. Pasta casseroles and lasagnas can work, but they will not brown on top unless you transfer them to the oven, and the sauces will not condense and deepen in flavor.Cakes and Other Pastries: Most cakes taste better, and will rise better when baked in the oven. This is because the multicooker steams rather than bakes them. The notable exceptions are cheesecake, delicate custards and puddings. They cook well in the multicooker’s moist environment, without the need to set up a Bain-Marie as you would in an oven. When cooking under pressure, use low pressure for custards and puddings to ensure the mixture doesn’t curdle. Hardier cheesecakes can stand up to high pressure. When using the slow cooker function, keep an eye on the water level so it doesn’t evaporate before the custard is set. It can take a while."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/27/dining/27INSTAPOT1/27INSTAPOT1-superJumbo.jpge3781e855cdd4642805d88587244693c	['Alison Roman', 'A Guide', 'Julia Moskin', 'Melissa Clark', 'Sam Sifton', 'Tara Parker-Pope', 'Pierre Franey', 'Martha Rose Shulman', 'Amanda Hesser']		How to Make Mac and Cheese	https://www.nytimes.com/	US	How to Make Mac and Cheese	1	"The CheeseThe rule for cooking with wine also applies to cheese: Don’t cook with anything you wouldn’t want to drink or eat on its own. On average, you’ll need a pound and a half to two pounds of cheese per pound of pasta. But the type of cheese can vary depending on the style of macaroni and cheese you are making and your preferred flavors and textures.Cheddar reigns here, somehow always behaving exactly as it should. It melts wonderfully, never breaking or becoming greasy, with just the right amount of salt and tang. Sharp, extra sharp and sharp white are best.To bolster flavor, adding a touch of something a bit more assertive like fontina or Gruyère is excellent, but be sure that at least half of the cheese used is Cheddar. Fontina and Gruyère are richer and fattier and could cause a sauce to break if used on their own. Avoid ultra mild cheeses like Monterey Jack or Colby: While they are fine for melting, they lack the salt or tang to make them worth your while.A bit of Parmesan or pecorino (up to an additional 1/4 cup grated) can always be added for deeper flavor and saltiness, but too much and the sauce could become grainy.Whatever cheese you use, it’s always best to grate from a block rather than buying pre-grated cheese (which can contain additives to prevent it from clumping in the bag).Now, in a perfect world, any cheese worth eating would be a good candidate for your macaroni and cheese, but that’s not the world we live in. There are many factors involved, including fat, salt, protein and water content, that make one cheese more suitable than another. For example, resist the urge to melt your favorite creamy Camembert (too fatty) or salty Gouda (too grainy) into this sauce. They’re much better as a sprinkle here and there.Beware of too much experimentation, though. If, in adding cheeses, you find your sauce appears broken, you can occasionally remedy it by whisking in more milk (if too thick) or Cheddar (if too runny) while it’s still warm. But unlike, say, mayonnaise, once dairy breaks, it’s often broken for good. It doesn’t mean your sauce is inedible; you may just need to lower your expectations. It’ll still be delicious, but not as creamy."	https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/dining/11MAC4/31MAC2-superJumbo.jpgc57731b82ac6468a9a4b2d9e4a600182	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The Flu Killed More Than 80,000 People Last Winter, The Highest Death Toll In At Least 40 Years	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The Flu Killed More Than 80,000 People Last Winter, The Highest Death Toll In At Least 40 Years	0	"More than 80,000 people in the US died from the flu last winter during what was a particularly nasty influenza season, the federal government estimated. It was the highest number reported in at least 40 years.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson confirmed the estimated death toll, first reported by the Associated Press, to BuzzFeed News Wednesday.""It was a really tough flu year,"" Colin Bucks, an emergency medicine physician at Stanford Health Care, told BuzzFeed News. ""It’s frustrating because it's preventable. It's stuff we prepare for every year.""The CDC estimates that since 2010, there have been between 140,000 and 710,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 flu-related deaths.Last winter's flu season started early, with a large number of cases occurring around the holidays, and struck infants and the elderly particularly hard. Activity continued to increase throughout January and remained high through the end of March.The outbreak included a mixture of three strains: H3N2, H1N1, and influenza B. The flu vaccine was not as effective against the H3N2 strain, the predominant strain, due to a genetic mismatch between the vaccine version of the virus and its wild form.Bucks said there's always the potential for the virus to cause a higher than normal number of deaths and that the best way to prevent infection regardless is to get vaccinated regardless of how effective the vaccine is that year.""Particularly if you're older, if you've got children, if you're pregnant, it's really important to get vaccinated,"" Bucks said.

The committee didn't identify the men, offer details about what they said, state whether committee staff found their accounts credible, or indicate whether there would be any further follow-up.The committee released a timeline describing how committee Chair Chuck Grassley and his staff had responded to misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, starting with Ford's account of being attacked at a party in the summer of 1982. On Sept. 24, the committee said that staff interviewed ""a man who believes he, not Judge Kavanaugh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982 that is the basis of his complaint.""Committee staff interviewed the man again the next day, on Sept. 25, according to the timeline. ""He described his recollection of their interaction in some detail,"" according to the committee.On Sept. 26, the committee received ""a more in-depth written statement"" from the man they had previously interviewed. Committee staff also spoke by phone ""with another man who believes he, not Judge Kavanuagh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982 that is the basis of her allegation. He explained his recollection of the details of the encounter.""A spokesperson for Grassley did not immediately return a request for comment. Lawyers for Ford also did not immediately return a request for comment.Ford and Kavanaugh are scheduled to testify Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee; Senate Republicans have brought in Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to ask questions on their behalf. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations. In written remarks submitted in advance of Thursday's hearing, Kavanaugh said that he ""never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.""""I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge,"" Kavanaugh wrote.Ford has stood by her accusation. In her prepared remarks, she recounted her claims that at a party while the two were in high school, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, and tried to take off her clothes. He covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream, she said. Ford said that another high school friend, Mark Judge, was also in the room.Judge's lawyer submitted a statement from Judge to the committee saying he had ""no memory of this alleged incident"" and ""never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.""""It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me,"" "" Ford wrote. ""Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.""Since Ford's accusations became public earlier this month, two other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, have come forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh has denied those allegations as well. The committee is only set to hear from Ford and Kavanaugh at Thursday's hearing."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/23/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/two-men-told-senate-staffers-they-had-the-encount-2-27551-1538019384-2_dblbig.jpgfc112bf8a7bb42d78c2023501d8672ae	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Senate Staffers Have Asked Brett Kavanaugh About An Anonymous Fourth Allegation Of Sexual Misconduct	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Senate Staffers Have Asked Brett Kavanaugh About An Anonymous Fourth Allegation Of Sexual Misconduct	0	"Senate Judiciary Committee staff have asked Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh about a fourth allegation of sexual misconduct, according to a transcript of a Tuesday phone call between aides and the judge.The allegation was initially reported to Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who received an anonymous letter on Monday alleging that Kavanaugh physically assaulted a woman he was dating after leaving a bar in Washington, DC, in 1998.The author said the woman was a friend of her daughter's and that her daughter and three others witnessed the incident.""Her friend was dating him. When they left the bar (under the influence of alcohol) they were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually,"" the letter stated.The woman called the author's daughter on Friday ""wondering what to do about it,"" the letter stated, but ""they decided to remain anonymous.""'Kavanaugh denied the allegation, calling it “ridiculous.""“We’re dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend,” he said, according to the transcript. “It’s ridiculous. Total twilight zone. And no, I’ve never done anything like that.”Gardner's press secretary, Casey Contres, confirmed that they received a letter about an alleged incident involving the judge in 1998 but declined to discuss its contents.""The letter contained no names, no address, and no contact info,"" Contres told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday.A spokesperson for Chuck Grassley, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the committee did not view the letter as credible and had no way to investigate the allegations made.""We have no reason to assign the letter credibility, and even if we did, we’d have no way to investigate the allegation as it was made anonymously and cannot be corroborated,"" the spokesperson said.News of the anonymous allegation comes just hours after another woman, Julie Swetnick, came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in a sworn affidavit.Swetnick alleged in the declaration that Kavanaugh and his friends helped spike the drinks of girls at high school house parties in the early 1980s to “cause girls to lose inhibitions and their ability to say ‘no.’”She also said that Kavanaugh was present when she was gang-raped at a party in 1982.Swetnick is the third woman to go public with sexual misconduct allegations after Christine Blasey Ford, the college professor who alleges Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school, and Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s who said he exposed his penis to her at a college dormitory party.Ford told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, tried to remove her clothes, and put his hand over her mouth to stop her from screaming at a high school party in Maryland when he was 17 and she was 15.She and Kavanaugh are scheduled to testify about the alleged incident before the committee Thursday.During the Tuesday phone call, committee staff members also asked Kavanaugh about allegations made by Swetnick's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, prior to the release of her affidavit, including that he was involved in ""a drug- and alcohol-induced gang rape"" and that entries in his yearbook made sexual references.""I've never participated in a gang rape. I've never participated in sexual activity with more than one woman present and me,"" Kavanaugh said, according to the transcript. ""In other words, I've never had a threesome or more than a threesome.""Avenatti, a prominent critic of the Trump administration who represented Stormy Daniels, also said Kavanaugh's yearbook refers to ""'FFFFFFFourth of July,' that is 'Fourth of July' with a total of seven Fs,'"" and that he believes that stands for ""find them, French them, feel them, finger them, fuck them, and forget them,"" according to the transcript.Kavanaugh said ""that's wrong"" and that the multiple Fs referred to an inside joke.""It refers to this one guy and his — and a joke that everyone had about him and how he said 'fuck you,'"" he said.Avenatti also told the committee that Kavanaugh's yearbook included the phrase ""devil's triangle,"" which he believes refers to a threesome involving two men and one woman, according to the transcript.Kavanaugh told the committee staff that devil's triangle ""refers to a drinking game where there were three glasses in a triangle,"" adding that he has never used the phrase to refer to sexual behavior.When asked about his general reaction to Avenatti's allegations, Kavanaugh said, ""I think it's absurd, outrageous, a joke, a farce, the twilight zone."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/21/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/senate-staffers-have-asked-brett-kavanaugh-about--2-19114-1538012043-0_dblbig.jpg1031bb579f00480ea8f54b0acd7f290c	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Here Are The Statements Brett Kavanaugh And Christine Blasey Ford Will Read To Senators	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Here Are The Statements Brett Kavanaugh And Christine Blasey Ford Will Read To Senators	0	"Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the college professor who alleges he sexually assaulted her in high school, released transcripts of the prepared testimony they plan to give before senators Thursday.Three women in total have so far accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct and assault.In his prepared testimony, Kavanaugh continues to deny all the allegations, calling them “last-minute smears” that “debase our public discourse.”In hers, Ford says she came forward because it was her civic duty.“I am here today not because I want to be.

On CNN, Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper will anchor from Washington, while Fox News’ coverage will be led by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and MSNBC’s early coverage by Stephanie Ruhle and Brian Williams (with Williams then anchoring coverage throughout the day).The big broadcast networks, NBC, ABC, and CBS, will also interrupt their regular daytime programming — or “pre-empt” in TV parlance — for special reports carrying the hearing.Ford, a professor in California, has alleged that she was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh during a party decades ago while in high school — allegations that the Supreme Court nominee has denied. After a weeklong negotiation, Ford agreed to testify. Two more women have since come forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.For viewers, the event may look and feel different from previous open hearings. Judiciary chair Chuck Grassley agreed to a set of terms from Ford’s attorneys, including allowing a representative “pool camera” and the limitation of wider press access. The hearing is also due to be held in a smaller room. Republican senators have selected Rachel Mitchell, a leading sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, to conduct questioning on their behalf.Networks’ wall-to-wall coverage could make for a particularly relentless news day. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Thursday to talk about “recent news stories,” days after rampant speculation and reporting that Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia probe, would be leaving his job.TV networks are preparing for Thursday as they did the last time a huge daytime programming event halted the wild news cycle: the testimony of former FBI director James Comey before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June of last year. About 19.5 million viewers tuned in to watch that spectacle, with more streaming online and watching at viewing parties.On ABC, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos will lead the network’s coverage from New York, with World News Tonight anchor David Muir taking over from Capitol Hill.On CBS, anchors from CBS This Morning — Gayle King, Norah O’Donnell, and John Dickerson — will be joined by CBS Evening News anchor Jeff Glor to lead the “gavel to gavel” coverage. Glor will broadcast his nightly news show Thursday evening from the network’s Washington bureau. On NBC, Nightly News anchor Lester Holt will be joined by Today coanchor Savannah Guthrie, Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd, foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell, and Megyn Kelly.Many viewers will, of course, instead stream the hearings online through various platforms, through networks’ livestreams or other platforms (CNN, for instance, said it would make its stream available without the usual requirement of a cable log-in)."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/21/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/the-tv-networks-are-going-all-in-for-the-brett-ka-2-18792-1538012818-0_dblbig.jpg635f93de30a74afa8b10845ff7c46555	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Four People Told The Senate That Christine Blasey Ford Told Them She Was Sexually Assaulted In High School	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Four People Told The Senate That Christine Blasey Ford Told Them She Was Sexually Assaulted In High School	0	"Four people submitted sworn affidavits to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying Christine Blasey Ford, who says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school, previously told them about the incident.Ford's lawyers submitted the documents — an affidavit from Ford's husband and three from her friends — Tuesday night to the committee.A committee hearing is set for Thursday to hear the testimony of Ford, now a professor at Palo Alto University, who has said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party when he was 17 and she was 15.On Wednesday, Ford's attorneys released the results of a polygraph test she took in August 2018 showing that the probability she had lied was low. During the examination, she recounted the story of the high school party and Kavanaugh's alleged assault, according to the document. Through multiple statistical analyses, the examiner found that her remarks ""not indicative of deception.""In her prepared remarks for Thursday's hearing, which were obtained by BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, Ford wrote that she and her family had been the target of harassment and death threats, and had been living in ""various secure locales"" since Sept. 16. Responding to claims that she was came foward for political reasons, she wrote, ""I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one’s pawn.""""My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh’s actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth,"" Ford wrote.Meanwhile, Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh in the 1980s, told the New Yorker in a piece published Sunday that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her at a college dormitory party when he was 18 years old.Ramirez's lawyers sent a letter to the FBI formally requesting an investigation into her allegations as part of Kavanaugh's background investigation Wednesday.Her lawyers also sent an email to committee requesting an FBI investigation.The letter also indicates that Ramirez is willing to cooperate with the committee, but that committee staff have refused to speak to her counsel. Instead, the letter states, staff has insisted Ramirez ""provide her evidence,"" first.""Respectfully, that demand misunderstands the process,"" attorney William Pittard wrote. ""Ms. Ramirez has not conducted an investigation to gather materials that she now somehow can present, gift-wrapped, to the committee.""Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted Wednesday afternoon that 20 committee investigators were speaking to witnesses and gathering evidence related to the allegations alongside federal law enforcement agents.Kavanaugh has denied he sexually assaulted anyone. In his prepared testimony, which was released by the committee on Wednesday, Kavanaugh said he was not perfect in high school, and ""drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends.""""In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now,"" he stated. ""But that’s not why we are here today. What I’ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.""He also denied Ford's allegations ""immediately, unequivocally, and categorically,"" adding that he has never sexually assaulted anyone.""The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of mylife,"" he said. ""The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.""Kavanaugh's representatives previously said he has 1982 calendars from his time in high school that don't mention the party in question, and those calendars are now public.The entries depict an activity-filled summer of camp, beach trips, hangouts with friends, and parties.The calendar includes mundane details, such as doctors appointments, workout sessions, haircuts, and when he was grounded, as well as outings with friends to watch Rocky III and a trip to New York with his mom and dad.The calendar lists a few parties that summer, including a “Holy Child” party on May 1, one on May 22 where he wrote “Timmy’s party beach,” another on June 25, “Go to party at boathouse with JC, Squi + Donny,” as well as “Anne Dougherty’s Party” on July 4.Ford has said that she doesn’t remember the specific date and location of the party where the alleged assault occurred, but that she believes it was in the summer of 1982 and that she was wearing a swimsuit underneath clothes.Kavanaugh’s lawyers argued that the calendar does not show a party consistent with what Ford described, according to the New York Times, adding that the entries don’t disprove her allegations as there may have been a party Kavanaugh didn’t write down.In the affidavits released by Ford on Wednesday, each individual recounts when and where they were when Ford disclosed that she had been allegedly sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh.Russell Ford, the professor's husband, said that details of the alleged assault first surfaced during a couples therapy session in 2012.“She said that in high school she had been trapped in a room and physically restrained by one boy who was molesting her while another boy watched,” Russell Ford wrote. “She said she was eventually able to escape before she was raped, but that the experience was very traumatic because she felt like she had no control and was physically dominated.”He later stated that his wife identified the alleged assailant as Brett Kavanaugh, adding that he remembers her saying “he was a successful lawyer who had grown up in Christine's home town, and that he was well-known in the Washington, DC community.”Her husband went on to say that Ford was very conflicted about whether to share her story publicly, but that “in the end, she believed her civic duty required her to speak out.”Keith Koegler, a close friend of Ford and her husband, also submitted a sworn affidavit saying he first learned of the alleged sexual assault in the summer of 2016.While discussing the case of Brock Turner, the former Stanford student who was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman behind a dumpster in 2015 and was later sentenced by a judge to six months in jail, Koegler said Ford told him she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now a federal judge in Washington, DC.The subject was brought up again in June, after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement from the Supreme Court."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/17/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/four-people-told-the-senate-that-christine-blasey-2-6275-1537996906-14_dblbig.jpg60ec9ae256da47629977c3fd05a95715	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Facebook Has Removed More Than A Dozen Big Conservative And Liberal Political Pages	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Facebook Has Removed More Than A Dozen Big Conservative And Liberal Political Pages	0	"Facebook said the pages were managed by a fake account and were spamming content from LifeZette, a conservative site.FacebookFacebook has removed over a dozen American hyperpartisan liberal and conservative pages with more than 30 million combined fans after discovering they were administered by the same fake account and were in violation of policies against spamming, a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. All of the removed pages had recently, and almost exclusively, been promoting links to LifeZette.com, the conservative website founded by Fox News host Laura Ingraham. It was sold last year to Canadian billionaire Daryl Katz, though Ingraham maintains a minority stake in the company, according to CNN. LifeZette's content continues to be heavily promoted on Ingraham’s social media accounts. (Her Facebook page and the main LifeZette page were not removed by Facebook. The company did not respond to requests for comment.) The removals come as Facebook says it is in the midst of stepped-up efforts to detect possible policy violations on political pages in advance of the midterms. The takedowns deal a huge blow to a group of once-prominent hyperpartisan publishers on Facebook, and reinforces how much that business has declined since 2016 thanks to algorithm changes and heightened policy enforcement by the social network. Last week, BuzzFeed News noticed that the now-removed pages had suddenly started sharing LifeZette.com content. LifeZette’s right-leaning stories were even being promoted on liberal Facebook pages such as Truth Examiner.Internet Archive/BuzzFeed Nrws / Via Facebook: truthexaminer Two LifeZette links that were shared on Truth Examiner before the page was removed.A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the coordinated sharing activity across pages helped trigger the review and ultimate removal of the pages. “Our systems detected a set of Pages with administrators who were using fake accounts and violating our spam policies,” the spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. “We've reviewed and removed accounts and Pages associated with this activity.""Help us break more stories with impact. If you want more reporting like this, become a BuzzFeed News supporter.The removed conservative pages include American News (more than 5.5 million fans), Mr. Conservative (2.1 million), Conservative 101 (2.1 million), and Proud to Be Conservative (2.2 million), along with at least three others.The liberal pages were Truth Examiner (3.7 million fans), Liberal Americans (2.1 million), Backed by Fact (1.5 million), and We Are Liberal (1.2 million), along with at least two others. In February of this year, a study by social analytics company NewsWhip found that a writer for Truth Examiner received more engagement for his content than any other reporter on Facebook. Facebook also removed two nonpolitical pages that were sharing LifeZette content, God Today (2.9 million fans), and Animal Amigos (1 million). The above pages were controlled by American conservative publishers Cyrus Massoumi, Tyler Shapiro, and John Crane. Shapiro and Crane are business partners and have worked closely with Massoumi over the years. American News, the largest of all the removed pages, was one of the top-performing American politics pages on Facebook during the 2016 election, according to a 2017 BuzzFeed News analysis. It was run by Shapiro and Crane, and Massoumi had posting privileges on it when it was removed. In an email to BuzzFeed News, Massoumi acknowledged he was working with LifeZette. He also provided a list of the removed pages. “The only pages that survived were pages that my partners [Shapiro and Crane] owned which were not posting [LifeZette] content” he said, adding that the removals affected “17 pages, 30m fans, and all of my advertising ability went down."" In subsequent emails, Massoumi asked that information he previously sent be considered off the record and said, ""I have no business relationship with LifeZette."" (BuzzFeed News had not agreed to speak off the record.) Shapiro and Crane did not respond to a request for comment. Along with American News and Conservative 101, the pair also controlled God Today, as well as pages targeting liberals on Facebook, as detailed in a previous BuzzFeed News investigation. Like many hyperpartisan publishers, their pages experienced a significant drop in engagement after 2016, according to data accessed in CrowdTangle prior to the page's removal. In July, BuzzFeed News revealed that American News was being rented out to men in India for $5,000 a month so they could use it share links to their US politics sites. (That practice is in violation of Facebook’s policies.)Facebook"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-8539-1537896010-1.jpg?crop=985:515;0,1420947c1f7d7a149559f474ff71682d77b	[]		Inspirational Quotes With Michael Scott	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Inspirational Quotes With Michael Scott	0	"OopsLooks like your browser doesn't support JavaScript."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/179226.jpg?output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&downsize=600:*771f78b3369e4581a3d72faf0efe1e6d	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Trump Says The Brett Kavanaugh Allegations Are False — But He Could Still Change His Mind	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Trump Says The Brett Kavanaugh Allegations Are False — But He Could Still Change His Mind	0	"Evan Vucci / APPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that he’s been falsely accused of sexual misconduct and so is inclined to reject the allegations from three women against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh — but, the president added, he could still change his mind. At a rambling press conference in New York City, Trump said repeatedly the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford and two other women were false and he questioned why they waited decades to come forward. But, Trump said, if Ford’s story is true, he’d withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. “If I thought he was guilty of something like this, yeah, sure,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question. Trump added that he “can always be convinced” by Ford’s testimony, which is set for Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ford will answer questions about an alleged 1980’s assault that took place when she was 15 and Kavanaugh was 17. Kavanaugh has denied the claim. “I do want to hear what she has to say. Maybe if she will say something,” he said. “But in the meantime, I have to tell you that [Kavanaugh] is one of the highest-quality human beings. He is a tremendous man. He is a tremendous genius. He has a great intellect.”Trump also said he believed Kavanaugh was the victim of a Democrat “con job,” a plot to obstruct the hearing process and destroy the judge’s reputation.Nicholas Kamm / AFP / Getty ImagesReporters pressed Trump on why he consistently sided with men accused of sexual misconduct rather than the women making the allegations. Several journalists asked whether it was because Trump has himself been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women.In response, Trump said he could recall four or five women who had made allegations about him, but he said they’d been paid to do so. “I’ve had numerous accusations about me,” he said. “They made false statements about me, knowing they were false. I never met them.” There is no evidence women were paid to lie about Trump, though attorney Lisa Bloom did set up a GoFundMe campaign for one woman who said she lost income after coming forward. “No one was paid to make up stories about him,” Bloom said in a statement Wednesday. “Ridiculous.”More than a dozen women have come forward publicly to say that Trump made inappropriate advances or sexually assaulted them. They include women he met professionally, via The Apprentice or his involvement with the Miss Universe pageant. “It does impact my opinion, you know why?” Trump said. “Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me. I’m a really famous person, unfortunately.” Mariann Wang, an attorney for Summer Zervos, who also accused Trump of sexual assault, criticized the president’s response. “It is offensive that in purporting to stand by a Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual assault, Mr. Trump has chosen once again to defame and attack women, including our client, who had the courage to come forward to tell the truth about his own unwanted assaultive behavior,” Wang said.Carlo Allegri / Reuters"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/19/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/trump-says-the-brett-kavanaugh-allegations-are-fa-2-9528-1538005043-0_dblbig.jpg2b9389a13e244255b178e02ee10ad402	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Watch Trump's UN News Conference Here But It Was A Lot So Maybe Take A Seat First	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Watch Trump's UN News Conference Here But It Was A Lot So Maybe Take A Seat First	0	"President Trump held a rambling news conference Wednesday at the United Nations in which he conceded that he might be open to changing his mind on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while also calling the sexual misconduct allegations a ""con job,"" all while repeatedly dismissing women reporters.Trump also said he would prefer not to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, referred to a Kurdish journalist as ""Mr. Kurd,"" and insisted that diplomats at the United Nations hadn't laughed at him this week — despite their own claims to the contrary.And that was just some of what was covered in freewheeling press conference that lasted for over an hour, taking jabs at several reporters who asked questions."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-13901-1538008758-1.jpg?crop=1455:761;0,2099a0690d92b3f46c0920e1a095ce80b9d	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Trump Says His “Preference Would Be To Keep” Rod Rosenstein At The Justice Department	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Trump Says His “Preference Would Be To Keep” Rod Rosenstein At The Justice Department	0	"President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he’d prefer to keep Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in his job at the Justice Department and that he might delay his meeting with Rosenstein, scheduled for Thursday.“My preference would be to keep him,” Trump said at a wide-ranging news conference in New York surrounding the United Nations General Assembly. He did not, however, rule it out, saying at one point, “[W]e’ll see.”Trump was asked specifically if he planned to fire Rosenstein, the number two at the Justice Department and the person who oversees the Russia investigation due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal.Trump said his preference would be to keep Rosenstein in his post “[a]nd to let him finish up” — a reference to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.“There was no collusion, there was no obstruction, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back. I do fight back. I really fight back,” Trump said. “I mean if you call that obstruction, that’s fine. But there’s no obstruction.”The week began with an erroneous Axios report Monday morning that Rosenstein had resigned, which was then followed by hours of intrigue and conflicting reports over whether he would remain in his job. Nonetheless, the day ended with Rosenstein still in his job and a meeting between the two set for Thursday.Now, though, Trump said that meeting might not even happen Thursday. He said he might call Rosenstein and ask for a “little delay” in their meeting because, Trump said, “I don’t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick.”Although Trump has repeatedly questioned Rosenstein’s future at the DOJ, the latest flare-up appeared to have come from a Sept. 21 New York Times report that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire to record the president and suggested pushing Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment — the amendment with a provision that empowers the vice president and the Cabinet to remove an incapacitated president. Rosenstein denied the accuracy of the report.Trump made clear on Wednesday that the 25th Amendment story was front and center in his mind.When asked about Rosenstein’s future, Trump initially said, “I’m talking to him. We’ve had a good talk. He said he never said it. He said he doesn’t believe it. He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice and we’ll see.”After a long aside about the Russia investigation and some of the other people who he has criticized previously, he returned and made explicit his focus on the 25th Amendment story.“He said he did not say it. He said he does not believe that — and nobody in this room believes it, by the way. I deal with the people in this room,” Trump said. “I was with [Secretary of State] Mike Pompeo before. We were dealing at a very high level with Japan. And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood. And I said them a long time ago and I was right. He said, ‘That’s not the 25th Amendment that I’'m looking at.’ I think I can say that from Mike.”But, it wasn’t all the 25th Amendment. Trump, unprompted, also referenced the Russia investigation, of which he said, “You know I call it a witch hunting, and it is a witch hunting.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/19/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/trump-says-his-preference-would-be-to-keep-rod-ro-2-23510-1538003300-2_dblbig.jpgf1d19d49f45746429f5914baaceae79f	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Here's All The Bizarre Stuff Trump Said About Women At His News Conference	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Here's All The Bizarre Stuff Trump Said About Women At His News Conference	0	"From not calling on women reporters, to telling one to sit down, to calling women ""angry,"" the whole thing went really well.Nicholas Kamm / AFP / Getty ImagesDuring a rare solo press conference Wednesday amid the mounting sexual misconduct allegations against his Supreme Court nominee, President Donald Trump repeatedly dismissed and interrupted women reporters, and brushed off those who have come forward to accuse powerful men, such as himself, of misconduct. After the president gave his statements and began taking questions, CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta asked the president if he would call on one of his ""female colleagues,"" since Trump had only called on male reporters. “If you don’t mind, after I’m finished, if Hallie or Vivian or one of the female colleagues could go after me, that would be great,” Acosta started. “Just to follow up on—"" Caught off guard, the president interrupted to ask, ""What does he mean by that?"" ""It would be great if a female reporter could ask a question about this issue,” Acosta repeated. “I wouldn’t mind that at all,” Trump said. ""Wouldn't make any difference to me.""CNN's Jim Acosta suggests Pres. Trump call on a female reporter after several questions from male reporters during press conference. ""I wouldn't mind that at all,"" Trump says. ""It wouldn't make any difference."" https://t.co/mZR1ia9igY https://t.co/B8rEqybj9cThen, after saying that he might change his mind about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after listening to Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to publicly accuse the judge of sexual misconduct, detail her allegations at Thursday's Senate hearing, Trump did call on two women correspondents: NBC News' Hallie Jackson and CBS News' Weijia Jiang. First, Jackson asked the president if he thinks Kavanaugh's accusers are liars, a question he deflected before going on a diatribe about George Washington and the FBI.The way Trump is treating @HallieJackson—cutting her off, talking over her, and pretending to poll the room on whether she should be ""allowed"" to ask another question—is deeply disrespectful and absolutely a continuation of how little the GOP thinks of women.Jackson kept trying to break in to ask a question, but the president repeatedly interrupted her before moving on to call on Jiang..@HallieJackson tries again: Do you think these women are liars? Trump: ""I can't tell you. I have to watch tomorrow...I have to see what happens tomorrow. I'm going to be watching... It's possible that they will be convincing."" https://t.co/pYxDaKbTVyJiang also pressed the president about his attitude toward women who have accused powerful men of sexual assault, including himself. ""How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women—,"" the White House correspondent said. ""I've been accused. False accusations,"" Trump interrupted before launching into another winding monologue about how the New York Times reported on his accusers. ""If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump. You didn't let me ask my question,"" she interjected. Then, the president told her to sit down. ""You've been asking a question for 10 minutes. Please sit down.""Watch President Donald Trump tell a female reporter to ""go sit down"" when she asks if she can ask her question after his rant https://t.co/k6qC6nUUfbThat command, obviously, did not go over well on the internet.Trump constantly interrupting a woman reporter and then telling her to sit down sums it all up pretty neatly.Trump telling a female reporter to “sit down” is basically exactly how I expected this press conference to goJiang, however, did not sit down, or abandon her query. Trump eventually let her ask a question before again defending himself against ""false allegations"" by women.The toughest reporter, who didn't sit down when Trump ordered her to -- @Weijia. Way to go!Fast-forward about 15 minutes and a variety of topics later, and the president called on another woman reporter. ""Are you at all concerned at the message that is being sent to the women who are watching this,"" she began, ""when you use language like 'con job' in relation to allegations of sexual—"" But Trump cut her off, chuckling, ""That's probably the nicest phrase I've ever used."" ""It's a con job...it's a confidence job...but it's a con job by the Democrats,"" he said in response to the women who have come forward with sexual misconduct allegations. ""What about the message that—"" But again, he interrupted the reporter before launching into a diatribe about how the people who have complained to him most about the Kavanaugh allegations are women. ""Women are very angry,"" he said. ""You know, I got 52% with women. Everybody said this couldn't happen. Women are so angry.""Pres. Trump on delays in Kavanaugh confirmation: ""The people who have complained to me about it the most... are women. Women are very angry."" ""Women are so angry, and I frankly think that... I think they like what the Republicans are doing."" https://t.co/n1nhbuBpmZ https://t.co/3WPe4IEu0UTrump added that angry women are more ""incensed"" than men about what is ""going on"" with the rocky Supreme Court nomination. ""Let somebody else have their day in court. But the ones that I find — I mean I have men that don't like it. But I have women that are incensed at what's going on,"" he said. ""I've always said women are smarter than men. I've said that a lot, and I mean it. But women are incensed at what's going on.""

They Won't Say.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Do Senate Republicans Still Think Anita Hill Was Lying? They Won't Say.	0	"WASHINGTON — As senators prepare to hear from Christine Blasey Ford about her accusations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Republican senators who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas 27 years ago won’t talk about Anita Hill, the accuser they didn’t believe in 1991.""That's not a question for today. I'm not going to answer that,” Sen. Orrin Hatch said on Wednesday when asked whether he still thinks Hill lied during her testimony in 1991.Hatch didn’t answer follow-up questions about whether he thought the process then was fair, when witnesses who said they would support Hill’s story were never called to testify. As in 1991, Democrats have pushed for witnesses that Ford says were present when she was assaulted by Kavanaugh to be called to testify under oath, but so far Republicans, including Hatch, have rebuffed those requests.At the time, Hatch said Hill had been “coached by special interest groups” and that her allegations were “too contrived” and “slick.” He has cast similar doubts on Ford’s allegations and those of the two other women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.As recently as 2010, Hatch reiterated that he still thought Hill was lying and said that she should apologize to Thomas and his wife. ""Look, I was there. I know this more intimately than almost anybody,"" he said at the time. ""And I can tell you that Clarence Thomas was telling the truth.""Two other top Republicans, Sen. Chuck Grassley, who currently heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, heard from Hill and voted to confirm Thomas in 1991. This week, they did not respond to questions about whether they think Hill was lying. BuzzFeed News reached out to roughly a dozen staffers who worked on Thomas’s confirmation as well. All of them did not respond or declined to comment.Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, who was a Democrat in 1991 but later switched parties, also voted to confirm Thomas after hearing Hill’s testimony, but he wouldn’t say much about Hill when asked this week if he had changed his mind about her testimony.“I just think the process ought to work. That’s what I thought then. That’s what I say here: You’ve got an accused, you’ve got an accuser. Let the process work. That’s what it’s about,” he said.Their silence on Hill comes despite the fact that her appearance 27 years ago looms over the Kavanaugh confirmation. The journalists Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer, who covered the hearings at the time, wrote a exhaustive investigation into the claims made by both Hill and Thomas at the time, ultimately siding with Hill in their 1994 book Strange Justice.And Hill reemerged as a prominent academic and commentator who now heads a commission on sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and frequently speaks out on the topic — including in a recent New York Times op-ed in support of Ford. And she has continued to gain a following among Democrats who believe her honesty was vindicated long ago.The view on from the conservative movement is the opposite: Thomas has since emerged as conservative hero on the court, a man who survived what he then called a “high-tech lynching.” Top conservatives still don't believe Anita Hill.Indeed, many conservative commentators are drawing parallels between Hill and Ford in recent weeks, suggesting that both women invented allegations to smear conservative judges.Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch and a frequent Fox News guest, told BuzzFeed News both Hill and Ford “are reluctant witnesses, because I don’t think their stories would hold up under too much scrutiny.”“Partisans and leftists, Democrats, have created another mythology. Clarence Thomas is on the Supreme Court because people didn’t believe Anita Hill,” he said.Fitton said he doesn’t think Hill was a credible witness, and that “Clarence Thomas effectively countered her testimony and was supported by the women he worked with.”But he said he thinks that with Ford, “maybe this person believes something happened to her, or something happened to her, and the question is if she’s able to convince anyone credibly that Kavanaugh is behind it. And that’s the hurdle she’s been unable to meet with anything she’s presented so far.”Sean Hannity, a Fox News celebrity and Trump ally, has been comparing the confirmation process for Kavanaugh and Thomas on both his TV show and radio program, making it clear he thinks Thomas was the subject of ""vile"" attacks.""I’ll never forget you know Clarence Thomas having to defend his name and honor, and the absolute viciousness of attacks against him,"" Hannity said in June on his radio show before the allegations against Kavanaugh surfaced.""One of the most powerful moments of testimony I can recall in my lifetime, and one of the most vicious, vile, unfair attacks against any one individual, in Justice Thomas's case, because he happened to be an African American that was a conservative. It was vicious.""He has since continued to defend Kavanaugh, repeatedly drawing parallels between him and Thomas. ""But what you are seeing is a political tactic that we have seen many times,"" Hannity said on his Fox News show last week. ""They did it to Judge Bork. They did it to Judge Clarence Thomas, and now it's Judge Kavanaugh. So, you also have a right to be skeptical.""Ann Coulter in a tweet this week suggested the allegations were lucrative for Hill and could be for Ford as well."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-29299-1538002526-17.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,115ba6fb5edc1684c7fb77ab59968c2bd02	[]		Does One Vote Even Matter?	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Does One Vote Even Matter?	0	"OopsLooks like your browser doesn't support JavaScript."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/179969.jpg?output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&downsize=600:*0a20688e5e1a4cc3bb2534742271e2b1	['Buzzfeed Staff']		13 Movie Scenes That Went Terribly, Terribly Wrong For The Actors	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	13 Movie Scenes That Went Terribly, Terribly Wrong For The Actors	0	"20th Century FoxThe script required an actor to ""tap"" Elwes on the head with his sword, but the sword was SO HEAVY, the force of the tap knocked him out for real. “That was the last thing I remember from that day’s shoot,” Elwes said. “I woke up in the emergency room, still in costume, to the sound of stitches being sewn into my head.

But later, he tweeted precisely once on the subject, noting that the Des Moines Register recently published a four-page ad from the Chinese government composed of previously published articles from the People’s Daily, a government-run newspaper.“Regrettably, we found that China is attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration,” Trump said. “They do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade. And we are winning on trade. We are winning at every level.”Addressing the United Nations Tuesday in a speech that was nominally about nuclear nonproliferation, President Trump pivoted briefly to a shocking accusation: that China was trying to swing the midterms against Republicans.China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news. That’s because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over! https://t.co/ppdvTX7oz1“It’s not surprising that China Daily sought to place advertising with the Des Moines Register, because the Register is Iowa’s largest news organization and Iowa farmers are disproportionately affected by China’s tariffs,” the Register’s executive editor, Carol Hunter said in a statement. She declined to say how much China paid for the ad.Experts largely agree that the country is deliberately targeting American farmers with tariffs in response to Trump raising tariffs on China. A recent Iowa State University study found that they could cost the state’s farming industry $2.2 billion.But it’s less clear that the tariffs are meant to help affect the midterm elections. Adam Segal, a China expert at the Council of Foreign Relations, said he viewed China’s attempts to target corn farmers as more of a broad “swing against the trade war” than a push to help elect Democrats to Congress.Later, at the UN, he told reporters China was “attacking our industrial — with ads, and with statements that don’t look like ads. It looks like they’re editorials and they’re not.”Then at a press conference Wednesday, he brought it up a third time, saying China “would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.”China, like the US and most other countries, spreads its influence in open ways, like with state-run media operations — the New York Times and Washington Post have run China Daily supplements, for example.But that falls short of “attempting to interfere” in US elections, a type of language the US intelligence community has reserved for Russia’s 2016 campaign, where military intelligence officers hacked US state voter registration databases and hacked and leaked Democrats’ emails and internal files.In recent months, several arms of the US government have geared up to fight foreign influence operations, including task forces at the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, as well as the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, which is tasked with taking the lead among the agencies. The FBI declined to comment. Several threat intelligence companies told BuzzFeed News they hadn’t seen significant Chinese hacking campaigns aimed at US election services.“They’ve actually admitted they’re going after farmers,” Trump said one final time after a question from a reporter on what evidence existed of Chinese meddling. “We have evidence. It’ll come out. I can’t tell you now.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-5780-1537996775-10.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,11561895822d3f84859b53d781de274786c	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The Secretary Of Homeland Security Said There Was “No Policy Of Separating Families.” A Memo Proves There Was.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The Secretary Of Homeland Security Said There Was “No Policy Of Separating Families.” A Memo Proves There Was.	0	"Kirstjen Nielsen maintained that the administration did not enact a family separation policy, but a memo she signed stated that the “zero tolerance” policy would have that effect.Carlos Barria / ReutersA memo signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen contradicts statements she made at the height of the family separation crisis last spring that the administration did not have a policy of separating children from parents. Nielsen signed off on the option to prosecute all adults who crossed the border illegally, including those with kids, knowing it would lead to family separations. The administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which sought to prosecute every adult caught crossing the border illegally, resulted in thousands of families being separated, with some parents being deported without their children. “DHS could also permissibly direct the separation of parents or legal guardians and minors held in immigration detention so that the parent or legal guardian can be prosecuted,” the memo said. When the administration was under fire for the family separations Nielsen told reporters “This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border.” Yet, the memo she signed states the effect of attempting to prosecute every adult at the border would result in children being separated from their parents.We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.The memo was reported on by the Washington Post in April, but this is the first time the document has been made public. It was obtained by Open the Government and the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) through a Freedom of Information Act request. Katherine Hawkins, an investigator at POGO, said in a statement that the redacted documents are a small part of what must be an extensive paper trail on family separation. She called for the release of more documents “so that the officials responsible can be held to account.” The memo was sent by Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan, Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services L. Francis Cissna, and Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan. It’s stamped with an April 23 date.Loren Elliott / Reuters An undocumented immigrant father from El Salvador and his 3-year-old daughter are released from detention with other families at a bus depot in McAllen, Texas.The document also says that illegal immigration at the US–Mexico border is on the rise. Noting that immigrant families detained at the border or deemed inadmissible at ports of entry, like asylum-seekers, averaged 450 per day over the previous 21 days. The immigration officials also said that family units encountered between April 18 and 19 reached the highest level since 2016 at almost 700 per day. The number of immigrants at the borders this year is higher than 2017’s but that year was an outlier. The numbers are coming off historically low numbers of apprehensions in 2017, and in fact are consistent with the number of people detained trying to cross the US–Mexico border in recent years that started dropping, for the most part, during the administration of President George W. Bush. This year’s apprehension numbers for March, April, and May are on par with figures for those same months in 2013, 2014, and 2016, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.Read the memo here: Open the Government, Project on Government Oversight / Via assets.documentcloud.org"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-27391-1537909522-7.jpg?crop=1360:712;0,1956b65439a20984aaa9e04db843ea55e1a	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The House Just Passed A Bill To Prevent Another Death Toll Disaster Like In Puerto Rico	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The House Just Passed A Bill To Prevent Another Death Toll Disaster Like In Puerto Rico	0	"After a year of uncertainty about the real number of people who died as a result of Hurricane Maria, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that aims to create a national standard for how deaths are counted in the aftermath of a disaster.The bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to work with the National Academy of Medicine to study best practices on how to count deaths after disasters, and to come up with policy recommendations for federal agencies.Currently, there are no national standards on what to count as a disaster-related death, just a list of CDC guidelines on how to fill out forms correctly after making that decision.The death toll is a measure of the severity of a disaster and the effectiveness of the response, but it also has direct financial implications for families who lost loved ones who can lose out on some federal assistance if those deaths are not counted.That was true in Puerto Rico, where in the weeks and months after Hurricane Maria, BuzzFeed News and the Puerto Rican Center for Investigative Journalism reported that there were inaccuracies in the death toll. Puerto Ricans who had lost family members both directly and indirectly as a result of the storm said they weren’t being counted in the official death toll. Funeral home and crematorium directors told BuzzFeed News they had received no clear instructions on how or when to report a death they thought was caused by the storm.In December, three months after the hurricane hit, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s administration said that 64 people had died as a result of the storm. The governor and officials in his administration repeatedly denied that there was any problem with their death toll counting at that time.But in August of this year, Roselló finally admitted that his administration’s death toll had been inaccurate because they did not have a clear system for deciding which deaths were hurricane-related during and after the storm. He requested an independent analysis, which was conducted by a team of independent researchers at George Washington University. Last month, the administration updated the death toll to 2,975, based on the GWU estimate.As a result of the initial inaccurate death toll following Hurricane Maria, thousands of Puerto Ricans have no official document confirming that their loved ones died because of the hurricane and are thus losing out on some federal assistance. Earlier this month BuzzFeed News reported that of 2,431 applications for funeral assistance after the storm, just 75 had been approved by FEMA by the end of July.“All this has to be part of this discussion because it’s just not right,” New York Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez, who sponsored the bill, told BuzzFeed News. “How can you think that families are going to go and apply for this kind of federal assistance if they don’t have proof that their relatives died? It’s just one after the other; how much more pain can be inflicted to those who lost loved ones?”The House passed the bill to create standards for disaster-related death tolls on Wednesday, two weeks after President Trump said he doesn’t believe Puerto Rico’s count. “3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,” he tweeted, adding that “This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible.”FEMA director Brock Long also cast doubt on the Puerto Rican governor’s updated death toll. In letters to members of Congress he also repeatedly said that local authorities are the ones who determine death tolls, and that FEMA plays no role in counting deaths. But the bill passed by the House Wednesday would require his agency to help create new standards for doing so.Velázquez said that if the president is going to question the death toll, his administration should also “get FEMA to work in setting up federal standards that will provide accuracy in terms of the death toll after disasters strike, direct and indirect.”Wednesday’s bill was passed after being incorporated into bipartisan legislation to fund the Federal Aviation Administration. It’s likely to pass the Senate easily as well and then head to Trump’s desk for his signature. (A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris in June)."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/the-house-just-passed-a-bill-to-prevent-another-d-2-4068-1538001808-0_dblbig.jpg194e371399f64431b7304ed3a8bf9322	[]		We Went On A First Date In Fortnite Duos	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	We Went On A First Date In Fortnite Duos	0	"OopsLooks like your browser doesn't support JavaScript."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/180215.jpg?output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&downsize=600:*4ff027c5bd844f948093e74f1f296f64	['Buzzfeed Staff']		This Is Where Babies Sleep In Six Countries Around The World	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	This Is Where Babies Sleep In Six Countries Around The World	0	"Getty ImagesWhat's the benefit of the Moses basket?

Reprodução Bartlam admitiu o homicídio de sua própria mãe quando tinha 15 anos em 2011. Ele bateu nela com um martelo, dentro da casa deles na Inglaterra, e depois colocou fogo em seu corpo. Aparentemente, Bartlam era um grande fã de filmes de terror, o que a polícia acreditou ter levado ao seu crime incrivelmente violento.5. Mary Bell. Bell tinha 10 anos quando cometeu seu primeiro assassinato, em 1968, estrangulando um garoto de 4 anos. No ano seguinte, ela também estrangulou um garoto de 3 anos. Neste segundo assassinato, teve um cúmplice, e eles marcaram suas iniciais no corpo do garoto, além de cortarem suas partes íntimas. Ela agora vive na Inglaterra sob um novo nome. — phandabox6. Joshua Phillips. Em 1998, Phillips, de 14 anos, assassinou sua vizinha Maddie Clifton, de 8 anos, e escondeu o corpo dela debaixo da sua cama. Ele a atingiu com um taco de beisebol e a esfaqueou 11 vezes. O corpo dela foi encontrado quando a mãe de Phillips notou um cheiro estranho vindo do seu quarto. —Roxanne Marie, Facebook8. Barry Dale Loukaitis. Loukaitis era um estudante de 14 anos na Frontier Middle School, em Washington (EUA), quando, em fevereiro de 1996, disparou e matou seu professor de álgebra e dois alunos. Em seguida, ele manteve a classe como refém durante uma hora até que uma professora de educação física apareceu, derrubou Loukaitis no chão e ajudou os alunos a escaparem.9. Lionel Tate. Tate tinha 13 anos quando foi condenado por ter matado uma menina de 6 anos enquanto os dois brincavam no porão da casa dele. Eles estavam supostamente lutando, e ele caiu de forma muito abrupta sobre a garota, dilacerando o fígado dela e fraturando seu crânio. Ele foi a pessoa mais jovem na história dos EUA até o momento a ser condenando à prisão perpétua.10. Jesse Pomeroy. Wikipedia Commons / Public Domain Pomeroy mais de uma vez mutilou outras crianças com facas e cintos. Então, em abril de 1874, matou uma menina chamada Katie Curran e jogou seu corpo no porão da loja de roupas da mãe dele, onde foi encontrado mais tarde. Aos 14 anos, foi a pessoa mais jovem da Comunidade de Massachusetts (EUA) a ser condenada por assassinato em primeiro grau.11. Eric Smith. Em 1993, Smith, de 13 anos, convenceu um menino de 4 anos a segui-lo até o bosque do Condado de Steuben, Nova York (EUA), onde Smith o estrangulou e esmagou sua cabeça. Já negaram sua liberdade condicional 11 vezes e ele fará uma nova tentativa em 2018.12. Cindy Collier e Shirley Wolf. Shirley Wolf tinha 14 anos e Cindy Collier tinha 15 quando decidiram esfaquear Auburn, uma mulher de 87 anos, até a morte em 1983, na Califórnia (EUA). Quando elas foram presas na mesma noite, a resposta de Wolf foi: ""Sim, nós fizemos isso"".13. Carl Newton Mahan. Reprodução Em 1929, Mahan, de 6 anos de idade, teve uma briga com uma garota de 8 anos sobre um pedaço de sucata que ambos queriam vender para ganhar dinheiro. Ela usou o metal para golpeá-lo no rosto, e ele reagiu matando-a com um tiro de espingarda. Ele cumpriu 15 anos na época.14. Craig Price. Price tinha 13 anos de idade quando matou uma pessoa pela primeira vez. Ele assassinou outras três antes de ser preso em 1989, aos 15 anos. Ele estava assustadoramente calmo e confessou todos seus assassinatos, revelando que usava como armas facas de cozinha.15. Alyssa Bustamante. Em outubro de 2009, Alyssa Bustamante, de 15 anos, esfaqueou e estrangulou uma garota de 9 anos no Missouri (EUA) porque ""queria saber como era o sentimento de matar alguém"". Em seguida, ela escondeu o corpo da menina debaixo de uma pilha de folhas em uma floresta nas proximidades.16. David Brom. Reprodução Em 18 de fevereiro de 1988, a família de Brom, de 16 anos, foi encontrada morta em sua casa em Minnesota (EUA). No dia anterior, ele supostamente havia dito aos colegas de classe que estava planejando matar sua família naquela noite. Ele foi preso e possivelmente poderia obter liberdade condicional em 2041.Este post foi traduzido do inglês.Veja também:"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/8/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/sub-buzz-25159-1533757210-1.png?crop=956:501;0,0ccac196379c04116a637e4f69f18cbc9	['Buzzfeed Staff']		We Can Tell How Gay You Are By How Many Of These Songs You Would Put On A Party Playlist	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	We Can Tell How Gay You Are By How Many Of These Songs You Would Put On A Party Playlist	0	"CheckGirls Aloud, but before you played it you would have to say to a straight ""OMG YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF GIRLS ALOUD?!"""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/2/17/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/we-can-tell-how-gay-you-are-by-how-many-of-these--2-3801-1533244703-0_dblbig.jpg9f924eb10e7b4b23ac842606619a6c3f	['Buzzfeed Staff']		Lindsay Lohan Just Snapped On Her Beach Club Employees For Not Wearing The Same Shoes And I'm YELLING	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Lindsay Lohan Just Snapped On Her Beach Club Employees For Not Wearing The Same Shoes And I'm YELLING	0	So in conclush, you BEST NOT wear out-of-uniform shoes around LiLo's establishment or she will COME 🔪 FOR 🔪 YOU 🔪 in the comments.	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/23/16/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/original-16683-1532376488-2.jpg?crop=1500:785;0,215b268e2fd717043e2a16bc79ec83cd4bc	['Buzzfeed Staff']		"The Rest Of The World Thinks This Is ""American Food"" And It's A Little Insane"	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	"The Rest Of The World Thinks This Is ""American Food"" And It's A Little Insane"	0	"Have you ever been walking through a grocery store and come upon the foreign food section?

Here are the completely jaw-dropping results.1. This diabolical plan: ""After my uncle died, we discovered that he had a second wife who he spent most of his time with. Literally no one on either side knew this for over 25 years. He also purchased the same prefab house, same furniture, and same everything for each of his wives so their houses mirrored each other (and probably helped him to keep his story straight)."" —avcmurrayThe CW2. This chilling testimony: ""My husband's grandmother was a Jewish teenager during WWII and was placed into a concentration camp. During this time, a Nazi guard fell in love with her and would bring her extra food, clothing, etc. He continued to protect her to keep her alive. When the war was over, she came to the US and started a new life. She told this secret to our family just days before she passed away."" —jessicaw456d24aec3. This insane story: ""My aunt poisoned my grandma for her inheritance. Everyone in my family knows about it, but it's just not talked about."" —erinl4ae5a3000Paramount Pictures4. This wild tale: ""My great-uncle was killed in a train accident in the '60s. I recently learned that he was having an affair at the time, and he got killed because he and his mistress were fooling around while they were parked on a railroad track! The train crashed right into them. No one in my family has ever really discussed it."" —emilyw42929c6005. This late confession: ""My dad created a Ponzi scheme of sorts by claiming he created an invention that turned water into energy. He defrauded thousands of people out of their money. When my dad ultimately went to prison, we believed it was just a mistake (not knowing where his money was really coming from), but a few months ago my mom revealed that he went to prison for a similar crime before I was born."" —Dallas Brady, FacebookABC6. This life-changing secret: ""I spent the last 40 years obsessing over my grandmother’s amazing family photo collection, which showcased our rich, dynamic, and loving family history. Well, last year she pulled out a secret photo album, containing several photos of my great-great-uncle, proudly posing in his SS Nazi uniform. I felt like my entire family history was a lie."" —richardp41bbe07ec7. This jealous affair: ""My grandma had an affair and got pregnant, so my grandfather got back at her by sleeping with the wife of the guy she had an affair with. Because of this, my uncle is technically only my half-uncle."" —amyp44337fcdbNBC8. This detective case: ""My brother and his ex-wife were swingers, and she happened to get pregnant. Ever since their daughter was born, we've had a family friend who always – I mean always – came to the child's big life events, like birthdays and recitals. It wasn't until recently when someone pointed out how similar that child and our family friend look. I’ve tried asking questions, but no one will give me a straight answer, so I’m convinced she’s not my brother's kid!"" —emilyh4b0ade4cf9. This bizarre turn: ""My aunt is actually my sister. My mom gave birth to my 'aunt' when she was 16, so my grandmother raised the baby as her own."" —cyeeanFox10. This riveting piece: ""My mom revealed that our Dutch ancestors hid a Jewish family in their attic and forged food stamps during WWII. If they were caught, they would have been killed, so it stayed a secret for a long time. No one in my family knew what happened to the Jewish family after the war. I hope they survived."" —Sasha Bee, Facebook11. This heartbreaking saga: ""My great-grandmother's brother married a woman who always looked extremely put together – perfect makeup and hair, etc. When she was on her deathbed, she admitted that she was actually black (albeit fairly light-skinned).

It was the highest number reported in at least 40 years.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson confirmed the estimated death toll, first reported by the Associated Press, to BuzzFeed News Wednesday.""It was a really tough flu year,"" Colin Bucks, an emergency medicine physician at Stanford Health Care, told BuzzFeed News. ""It’s frustrating because it's preventable. It's stuff we prepare for every year.""The CDC estimates that since 2010, there have been between 140,000 and 710,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 flu-related deaths.Last winter's flu season started early, with a large number of cases occurring around the holidays, and struck infants and the elderly particularly hard. Activity continued to increase throughout January and remained high through the end of March.The outbreak included a mixture of three strains: H3N2, H1N1, and influenza B. The flu vaccine was not as effective against the H3N2 strain, the predominant strain, due to a genetic mismatch between the vaccine version of the virus and its wild form.Bucks said there's always the potential for the virus to cause a higher than normal number of deaths and that the best way to prevent infection regardless is to get vaccinated regardless of how effective the vaccine is that year.""Particularly if you're older, if you've got children, if you're pregnant, it's really important to get vaccinated,"" Bucks said.

She also said her dad would often kiss across her arms and neck while they watched movies on the couch, and pin her against the refrigerator or dishwasher, MPR reported .""As a result, I feel I have no choice but to effectively end my campaign today so that I can work towards healing my family,"" Knoblach said in a statement. ""As indescribably hurtful as these circumstances are, my wife and I love our daughter, and we look forward to the day when we can somehow again be a happy family.""Republican state Rep. Jim Knoblach denied the allegations but said he was ""not willing to spend six weeks fighting with [his] daughter in the media"" as Minnesota Public Radio prepared to publish a detailed account of the accusations .A longtime Minnesota state lawmaker abruptly ended his reelection campaign Friday after his 23-year-old daughter accused him of inappropriately touching her throughout her childhood and young adult life.""It felt inappropriate,"" Laura Knoblach told BuzzFeed News by phone Saturday night. ""I didn't like it and I'd voice that I wouldn't really want to do that but it didn't really seem to matter to him.""According to their report, Laura Knoblach told friends, family, and adults at her school and church about her dad's behavior for more than a decade. In December 2016, after she had moved away from her family to Boulder, Colorado, for college, she wrote on Facebook that she had been ""molested as a child and young adult"" by her dad and that her family ""coerced [her] into silence about it for almost 15 years.""The now-deleted post prompted an uncle to call the police, and in January 2017 the St. Cloud Police Department and Sherburne County Sheriff's Office opened an investigation, according to MPR. No charges were ever filed.MPR reviewed documents, including written transcripts of interviews, copies of old diary entries, and handwritten notes, as well as audio files from the investigation.Laura Knoblach told law enforcement that sometimes her father would come into her room to pray and lift up her shirt and kiss her stomach.When she was home for the 4th of July in 2015, Laura Knoblach said she was walking through the garage at their house from the backyard where her parents were shooting off fireworks when her dad pinned her against a car and licked and kissed her neck, she told BuzzFeed News.""He grabs my wrist and he pushes me up against our car and he's holding my wrist to the car ... and rubbing his body against me, and he started licking and kissing my neck and biting my ear,"" she said.That same night, her father allegedly put his face between her legs repeatedly, kissing and licking them, while the family was watching a movie together.""My mom said, 'Jim, that's not appropriate to be doing to your adult daughter,' and he kind of looked up at her and laughed and continued doing it,"" Laura Knoblach told BuzzFeed News. ""I told him to stop and I tried to push him away.""The station reported that, according to the documents, St. Cloud police officer Trent Fischer told Laura Knoblach that her father's actions were ""really inappropriate but not criminal"" and that they wouldn't be able to bring charges against him because her father did not expose himself or touch her under her clothes.Jim Knoblach's attorney Susan Gaertner told BuzzFeed News the lawmaker ""has been physically affectionate"" to both his daughter and his son, but he ""does not believe he crossed any lines.""Gaertner said Jim Knoblach first learned of the ""nature of the allegations"" when his daughter wrote about them on Facebook.""He was shocked, he was concerned, and he was very sad,"" Gaertner said, adding that prior to the post he knew about ""some complaints she had about boundaries but again the detail and the real nature of the allegations came much later.""She declined to comment on the specific allegations.""This is a very sad, private family matter, and in order to keep it as best he can out of the public arena going forward he dropped out of the race,"" Gaertner said.Laura Knoblach said family members would always tell her that her dad just ""doesn't understand boundaries,"" and so for a long time she felt like her discomfort was the problem.""I felt like I have to work through this because clearly my feelings are the ones that are wrong,"" she said.But the more that she talked to friends and a counselor at school, the more she came to realize she wasn't wrong. She said she hopes coming forward will help her heal.""A lot of children that have been abused by their parents don't want their parents to go to jail. They just want to be free of those feelings,"" Laura Knoblach said.

Jerry Brown Thursday.The new law prohibits full-service, dine-in restaurants from providing single-use plastic straws unless requested by customers.In a letter to legislators, who passed the legislation last month, Brown called the law “a very small step” to help reduce waste from single-use plastic products.“And it might make them pause and think again about an alternative,” Brown wrote. “But one thing is clear, we must find ways to reduce and eventually eliminate single-use plastic products.”Several cities in the Golden State have previously adopted policies regulating or banning the use of plastic straws, including San Francisco, Davis, and Malibu.Straws are the sixth most common item found during beach cleanups, according to the California Coastal Commission. During cleanups between 1988 and 2016, the agency reported collecting 835,425 straws.The legislation does not prevent cities or counties from adopting stricter ordinances to further regulate plastic straw use.Violators could face fines of $25 for each day the restaurant is in violation.The anti-straw movement has been around for more than a decade but gained steam in 2015 thanks to a video of a plastic straw being pulled out of sea turtle’s bloody nose.In recent months, Seattle’s ban has taken effect and San Francisco moved to adopt its own. In July, Starbucks announced it would stop offering plastic straws in all of its stores by 2020. Other companies, including Marriott International and American Airlines, have taken similar steps.Plastic straws often end up in the ocean, where they endanger aquatic animals and contribute to pollution. Studies estimate that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean when measured by weight by 2050.A recent poll found most Americans would rather see businesses limit straws than have an all-out ban."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/20/17/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/california-just-became-the-first-state-to-ban-res-2-8409-1537478599-0_dblbig.jpg51fa1f7d7e714b06895a3d40d6b3852f	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		"California's Suspected ""Gypsy Hill Killer"" Was Found Guilty Of Killing Two Teen Girls In 1976"	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	"California's Suspected ""Gypsy Hill Killer"" Was Found Guilty Of Killing Two Teen Girls In 1976"	0	"A California jury has found a career criminal believed to be the so-called ""Gypsy Hill Killer"" guilty of the 1976 killings of two teenage girls in the suburbs south of San Francisco.Rodney Halbower, 70, was accused of kidnapping, sexually assaulting, and then stabbing Veronica Cascio, 18, and Paula Baxter, 17, to death before dumping their bodies in two separate slayings in early 1976.

Halbower “literally came out of the darkness and viciously raped and murdered” them, Gallagher said.Investigators ultimately concluded that Halbower could not have committed one of the Gypsy Hill murders because he was in prison at the time, and authorities did not uncover any DNA evidence for the other two killings, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe told BuzzFeed News."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/18/21/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-23944-1537321133-1.jpg?crop=1244:651;0,178d45e2917f01d47e9997b4f5846d532a5	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Typhoon Mangkhut Has Torn Through The Philippines And Southern China, Killing At Least 69 People	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Typhoon Mangkhut Has Torn Through The Philippines And Southern China, Killing At Least 69 People	0	"The tropical cyclone Mangkhut was packing winds of up to 100 mph as it reached China on Sunday.Aaron Favila / AP A taxi is abandoned in floodwaters during Super Typhoon Mangkhut in Hong Kong on SundayTropical cyclone Mangkhut, which reached the southern coast of China on Sunday, has killed at least 69 people — including 65 in the Philippines and four in China, according to state media.

The professional tennis world responded to the match, with some players defending Williams. Playing in her 31st Grand Slam final — and her second since giving birth — Williams lost to 20-year-old Naomi Osaka, the first Japanese woman to win a major tournament, after losing a point and a game to penalties for three consecutive code violations. The United States Tennis Association said on Sunday that Williams was fined $17,000 for the game: $4,000 for the coaching warning; $3,000 for smashing her racket; and $10,000 for the ""verbal abuse."" It all started when Carlos Ramos, the chair umpire, accused Williams of getting coaching from the box — a charge that the most decorated athlete in women’s tennis took with offense. “I understand why you may have thought that was coaching but I’m telling you it’s not. I don’t cheat to win. I’d rather lose. I’m just letting you know,” Williams told the umpire.""I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose."" — Serena Williams just now to the chair umpire #USOpen18The umpire issued Williams a code violation for coaching, which is against the rules. But it was unclear if she was aware of that because she appeared stunned after receiving another code violation, for breaking her racket in frustration, which resulted in a point penalty. After seeing the point deduction in the score, Williams resumed the argument with Ramos, telling him that he owed her an apology for accusing her of getting coaching. “You owe me an apology,” she told the umpire. “I have never cheated in my life.” Later on, while again demanding an apology, Williams told Ramos, “You stole a point from me. You’re a thief, too.” For that, Ramos gave her a third code violation for verbal abuse, resulting in a game penalty that put Osaka just a few serves away from her first Grand Slam win.Here’s a video of the interaction: ""You owe me an apology!"" Serena was fired up with the official in the final set of the US Open final.As the referee consulted with Ramos, Williams, near tears, addressed Women’s Tennis Association supervisor Donna Kelso, saying it was not right that she was penalized for coaching. “I was not being coached,” Williams said. “You know me. You know my character and that’s not right. This is not fair. This has happened to me too many times.” “You know how many other men do things — they do much worse than that. This is not fair,” Williams continued. “There’s a lot of men out here that have said a lot of things and because they are men that does not happen to them.” In an interview after the match, Williams’ coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, admitted to coaching, but said he didn’t think his player was looking at him, and accused the umpire of enforcing the rule inconsistently. “I was like 100% of the coaches in 100% of the matches,” Mouratoglou told a reporter. He pointed out that Ramos has chaired finals for Rafael Nadal, whose coach, Mouratoglou said, is “coaching every single point.” “They never gave a warning. I don’t really get it. It’s strange,” he added. During a press conference after Saturday’s match, Williams said she felt it was sexist for Ramos to take a game away from her. “He’s never taken a game from a man,” she said. “This is outrageous.” She concluded saying she hoped that the controversy, while unfavorable for her, would be beneficial for the next woman player who “has emotions and wants to express themselves.” “Maybe it didn’t work out for me, but it’s going to work out for the next person,” Williams said. It was not the first time Williams was penalized for arguing with US Open officials. In 2009, she was fined $82,500 and placed on probation for cursing out and threatening a lines person who called a foot fault against her. She was again fined in 2011 for arguing with the umpire during the championship match.Unsurprisingly, the controversy sparked lots of reaction online about whether the penalties were fair and if they represented a double standard in tennis. Two gender-related points about #USOpen: (1) Serena Williams is right that male and female players are judged differently. That's why only women get warnings for shirt changes. (2) Naomi Osaka apologized to the crowd, even though she had absolutely nothing to apologize for.“All fair.” Mouratoglou admitted to ESPN that he coached. Thus, the warning was correct by Ramos. Then, racket abuse warning was indisputable. Williams felt entitled to having coaching warning retracted, which never happens. So she ranted abusively, and got a third warning. All fair.“...even if you think Patrick Mouratoglou was coaching, that doesn’t justify taking a whole game from Serena Williams for arguing.” I think people need to understand that even if you think Patrick Mouratoglou was coaching, that doesn't justify taking a whole game from Serena Williams for arguing. #USOpen“He showed absolutely no discretion and common sense.” My take on Serena: tennis has long had a problem with chair umpires who insert themselves into the action. Happened twice this Open. They only way to end this is to make a point with this Ramos and strip him of his duties. He showed absolutely no discretion and common sense“Ridiculous behavior here from Serena Williams ... demanding an apology from umpire Carlos Ramos, who is merely doing his job.” Ridiculous behaviour here from Serena Williams, angrily pointing her finger and demanding an apology from umpire Carlos Ramos, who is merely doing his job #USOpen“Men players get away with far more abusive language to chair umpires and it seems like every player’s coach signals from the box without getting called for it.” Serena is right: Men players get away with far more abusive language to chair umpires and it seems like every player's coach signals from the box without getting called for it. But even without the game penalty, not sure Serena would've survived against sensational Naomi Osaka.Retired tennis player Andy Roddick at first called the rulings the “worst refereeing I’ve ever seen,” but later said Ramos was “within his power to make that call.” Emotional first take by me. common sense should’ve prevailed in my opinion. He’s within his power to make that call. I’ve seen an umpire borderline coach a player up,and another dock a game for being called a thief in same tourney. There needs to be some continuity in the future https://t.co/T5oI1M0Cu7Tennis legend Billie Jean King also weighed in and argued that coaching should be allowed in tennis. (1/2) Several things went very wrong during the @usopen Women’s Finals today. Coaching on every point should be allowed in tennis. It isn’t, and as a result, a player was penalized for the actions of her coach. This should not happen.“When a woman is emotional, she’s ‘hysterical’ and she’s penalized for it. When a man does the same, he's ‘outspoken’ & there are no repercussions.” (2/2) When a woman is emotional, she’s “hysterical” and she’s penalized for it.

Jerry Brown's desk after it was approved by the state Senate in a 27–12 vote Friday, would prohibit internet providers from slowing down websites, charging premiums for higher-quality streaming, and demanding payments from internet companies to reach subscribers.The bill, coauthored by San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, would also prohibit zero-rating data, a practice in which internet providers exempt certain websites or services from counting toward a customer's data usage. Zero-rating entire categories of apps and services, like all music streaming apps, would still be allowed.Brown's office said it doesn't comment on legislation awaiting action by the governor.“This is about a level playing field and an internet where we as individuals get to decide where we go on the internet, instead of being told by internet service providers or being manipulated by internet service providers into going where they want us to go,” Wiener said during a press conference after the bill's passage."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/31/20/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/original-27896-1535761696-2.jpg?crop=2965:1552;0,425dd64e66cb8eb4fa398eeb503c133c7b0	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		California Could Soon Become The First State To Restrict The Use Of Plastic Straws	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	California Could Soon Become The First State To Restrict The Use Of Plastic Straws	0	"Straws are the sixth most common item found during beach cleanups, according to the California Coastal Commission. During cleanups between 1988 and 2016, the agency reported collecting 835,425 straws.Several cities in the Golden State have already adopted policies regulating or banning the use of plastic straws, including San Francisco, Davis, and Malibu.Brown's office said it doesn't comment on legislation before it reaches his desk, but the governor did sign a law in 2014 banning single-use plastic bags at grocery stores, pharmacies, and liquor stores.The legislation, which awaits Gov. Jerry Brown's signature after passing the Assembly on a 45–20 vote, would prohibit full-service, dine-in restaurants from providing single-use plastic straws unless requested by customers.California is about to become the first state to restrict the distribution of plastic straws at restaurants under a bill approved by lawmakers Thursday.The state assemblyman who introduced the legislation in January, Ian Calderon, a Democrat from Whittier, has said providing straws only upon request will help the state meet solid waste goals and reduce plastic pollution.""It’s something that's a convenience that we’re just used to but it is generally — for most people — unnecessary,"" Calderon told BuzzFeed News, acknowledging that straws are a necessity for some like people with disabilities. ""It’s a small step, but in the scheme of things, it’s a significant step because before we even started to take this step nobody was talking about it.""The legislation does not prevent cities or counties from adopting stricter ordinances to further regulate plastic straw use.Violators could face fines of $25 for each day the restaurant is in violation.The anti-straw movement has been around for more than a decade, but gained steam in 2015 thanks to a video of a plastic straw being pulled out of sea turtle's bloody nose.In the past few months, Seattle’s ban has taken effect and San Francisco moved to adopt its own. Last month, Starbucks announced it would stop offering plastic straws in all of its stores by 2020. Other companies, Marriott International, American Airlines, and the Walt Disney Corporation, have taken similar steps.Plastic straws often end up in the ocean, where they endanger aquatic animals and contribute to pollution. Studies estimate that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean when measured by weight by 2050.Jackie Nunez, founder of the Last Plastic Straw and project manager for the Plastic Pollution Coalition, said that while she wished California's legislation was more comprehensive to include fast-food restaurants and other single-use items, it was a step in the right direction toward reducing waste.""It's a common sense approach,"" Nunez told BuzzFeed News. ""It's a win-win for everyone. The businesses save money and our municipalities save money not only in waste but also in source reduction and cleanups."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/23/19/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/original-11874-1535065953-6.png?crop=652:341;0,77c461a99862a24b40b74f1b08b9f4a13e	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Ohio State Has Suspended Its Football Coach And Athletic Director For Mishandling Domestic Abuse Allegations	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Ohio State Has Suspended Its Football Coach And Athletic Director For Mishandling Domestic Abuse Allegations	0	"Ohio State University has suspended its football coach and athletic director after an independent investigation found they failed to adequately report allegations of domestic abuse against an assistant coach three years ago, officials announced Wednesday.Coach Urban Meyer will be suspended without pay until Sept. 2, as well as for the first three games of the season, while Athletic Director Gene Smith will be suspended without pay from Aug. 31 until Sept. 16, Ohio State President Michael Drake said.""We believe Urban Meyer did not and does not condone domestic abuse.

Duncan Hunter and his wife allegedly used more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for family trips, dental work, and other personal expenses.Alex Brandon / AP Rep. Duncan Hunter and his wife Margaret pose with former House Speaker John Boehner in 2011.Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter and his wife were indicted Tuesday on charges that they used more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses, including family vacations, school tuition, and theater tickets, federal prosecutors said. The indictment, filed in San Diego federal court, alleges that Hunter and his wife, Margaret Hunter, illegally used the campaign money between 2009 to 2016, and then covered it up by falsifying campaign finance reports. An early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Hunter is currently running for a sixth term in Congress. His indictment follows that of New York Rep. Chris Collins, another early Trump supporter who was charged last month with insider trading and lying to the FBI. The Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned on the indictment Thursday. They face charges of conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud, falsification of records, and prohibited use of campaign contributions.“The indictment alleges that Congressman Hunter and his wife repeatedly dipped into campaign coffers as if they were personal bank accounts, and falsified FEC campaign finance reports to cover their tracks,” US Attorney Adam Braverman said in a statement. “Elected representatives should jealously guard the public’s trust, not abuse their positions for personal gain. Today’s indictment is a reminder that no one is above the law.”Joe Raedle / Getty ImagesHunter, a former Marine, has held his conservative inland San Diego County district since 2008 when he succeeded his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., who represented the area for more than two decades. Though the district is solidly Republican — Trump won it by 15 points in 2016 — the investigations into Hunter's finances have made it a target for Democrats in this year's midterms.In a statement to BuzzFeed News Tuesday, a spokesperson for Hunter, Michael Harrison, said the congressman ""believes this action is purely politically motivated."" Harrison also pointed to a letter sent by Hunter's lawyer to the Justice Department, which accuses prosecutors of political bias, and claims the investigation into Hunter's campaign finances arose from his early support for Trump. The ""sudden rush to indict reflects a loss of impartiality and appears to be an effort to derail Congressman Hunter's reelection in the November 6, 2018 general election,"" the lawyer, Gregory Vega, wrote. ""Indeed, if Congressman Hunter is indicted now under suspicious circumstancesthat could swing a solidly Republican seat in the mid-term elections, the harm to both my client and the democratic process will be grave and irreparable,"" Vega wrote. According to the indictment, the Hunters overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times between 2009 and 2016, racking up nearly $38,000 in overdraft and insufficient funds fees. The couple also frequently hit the credit limit on their their credit cards, resulting in $24,600 in finance charges, interest and other fees, the filing said.""By virtue of these delinquencies — as well as notifications of outstanding debts and overdue payments from their children's school, their family dentist, and other creditors — the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could only be made by using campaign funds,"" court documents said. Those purchases included hotel rooms, airline tickets, and vacations for themselves and their friends and family to destinations including Italy, Hawaii, Las Vegas, and Lake Tahoe, according to the indictment. The couple also allegedly used campaign funds to pay for more mundane items, like groceries, fast food, children's books, tickets to the play How the Grinch Stole Christmas, golf outings, an iPod nano, and airline tickets for a family pet. To conceal the purchases, the Hunters mischaracterized the expenses as ""campaign travel,"" ""dinner with volunteers/contributors,"" ""toy drives, ""gift cards"" for charitable donations, and ""gift basket items,"" among other descriptions, according to the court documents.Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call,Inc.

Spacey plays Beverly Hills con artist Ron Levin.According to Variety and the Hollywood Reporter, the film was quietly released in 11 theaters across the country Friday, making just $126 on its opening day.It premiered on premium video on demand, or VOD, in July. Later on Monday, BuzzFeed News learned from a source with knowledge of the release that the movie stands to earn upwards of $1 million to $2 million through digital rentals and sales.In June, distributor Vertical Entertainment vowed to still release Billionaire Boys Club, saying it was “neither an easy nor insensitive decision.”“We hope these distressing allegations pertaining to one person’s behavior — that were not publicly known when the film was made almost two-and-a-half years ago and from someone who has a small, supporting role in Billionaire Boys Club — does not tarnish the release of the film,” Vertical said.It marks a box office low for Spacey and is the latest sign of the power of the #MeToo movement. By comparison, Spacey’s last film, Baby Driver, earned $20.5 million its opening weekend in June 2017.That was just a few months before harassment allegations against the Academy Award winner came to light, following an October BuzzFeed News story in which Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making sexual advancements toward him in 1986 when Rapp was a teenager. Since then, more than a dozen men have accused Spacey of sexual assault, harassment, and lewd behavior dating back decades.In a statement responding to Rapp’s allegations, Spacey publicly acknowledged that he is gay and offered the younger actor “the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.”In the wake of the allegations, Netflix dropped Spacey from the sixth and final season of House of Cards. He was also replaced by Christopher Plummer in Ridley Scott’s 2017 film All the Money in the World, an unprecedented move that required the filmmaker to reshoot scenes already filmed with Spacey.Authorities in Los Angeles and the United Kingdom have confirmed they are reviewing claims of sexual assault against Spacey."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/18/18/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/original-11342-1534632759-2.jpg?crop=2117:1108;0,3034e63297ec715408c93bc543bd0de0622	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		14 People Were Injured After A Storm Hit A Backstreet Boys And 98 Degrees Concert In Oklahoma	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	14 People Were Injured After A Storm Hit A Backstreet Boys And 98 Degrees Concert In Oklahoma	0	"At least 14 people were injured while waiting in line for a Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees concert in Oklahoma Saturday after high winds and heavy rains knocked over the entrance to the concert venue.WinStar World Casino and Resort officials began to evacuate the outdoor venue at about 5 p.m. after seeing lightning within four miles of the casino.The casino, which is owned by the Chickasaw Nation, said in a statement that about 150 patrons who were standing in line ""did not heed staff's warnings.""

But experts warn that the tips given on these pages could do more harm than good.Tim Lane / Getty / BuzzFeedOver the past year, Instagram has been taken over by a trend known as “thread” accounts. Usually run by teenagers, they feature screenshots from other social media platforms, like Twitter, and are focused on sharing life advice with the millions of young people flocking to Instagram. The owners of these accounts post about things like skin care, beauty tips, weight loss, and mental health, and have racked up hundreds of thousands of followers. They've become mini content empires all their own, and earn thousands of dollars in ad revenue. These accounts have also become a breeding ground for unvetted, inaccurate, and at-times dangerous health guidance. Health experts might dispute a post suggesting a diet of eggs, yogurt, salad, oatmeal, and blueberries to lose weight, or have qualms about a page promoting a two-week summer tone-up routine that promises results if you stop snacking, work out, and jog for 30 minutes a day, while also featuring the disclaimer “please don’t overwork yourself or miss meals.” Another page appears to promise abs by just doing basic core exercises. And another seems to recommend face masks that contain apple cider vinegar for acne, an ingredient that can cause burns. BuzzFeed News has reached out to these accounts for comment. All of it comes packaged up with high-res aspirational photography of young women and branded with the vague banner term of “self-care,” a catch-all popular phrase for a generation of teenagers who grew up on the internet talking openly about mental health awareness and who have never know any other world than our current post-Kardashian sponcon nightmare. Andi, who requested that her last name not be included because she said she prefers to keep her personal life separate from Instagram, is the 16-year-old owner of skincarethreadsis. The account has over 265,000 followers and it’s one of the most prominent self-care thread accounts right now. She posts up to several times a day and the content is largely uniform: Instagram carousels that start with a screenshot of a tweet like “Reasons why your skin keeps breaking out.” Then as you swipe through the carousel, subsequent tweets list things like “you’re scrubbing your skin too hard,” “eating spicy foods,” or “you pick at your pimples.” Andi also includes ads in her threads. Andi’s page, like many of these accounts, bills itself as a skin care account, but as it’s become more popular, she has expanded it to cover every subgenre of “self-care.” Another thread post starts with a tweet that reads, “Snapchat Message Hack,” then if you click through, there’s a video showing how to view snaps without the sender knowing. Her Snapchat hack thread includes promos for her other Instagram accounts and an ad for an app that an app that promises to pay users for walking. The post has over 8,000 likes and 200 comments. “I sort of consider Instagram as a job for me,” Andi told BuzzFeed News. “I make money from my account as I do promotions where someone pays me via PayPal and then they send me what they want me to post.”While Instagram’s Terms of Service do not explicitly ban users from making money on the app, it does state in its commerce guidelines that selling unsafe supplements and health products under its shopping tool is prohibited. When asked about self-care threads and the concerns around them, Instagram provided the following statement to BuzzFeed News: ""Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place is our number one priority. Anyone can report content they think is against our community guidelines using our in-app tools and we have a team of reviewers working 24/7 to remove material that violates our policies."" The “self-care"" branding Andi and the majority of these accounts use started as a reaction to the wellness movement of the 1960s. The modern interpretation of self-care has ballooned out in the last decade to define a constellation of health concerns like exercise, healthy eating trends, and self-led personal care, all of it usually emphasizing a do-it-yourself ethic and anti-science skepticism. Recently, companies like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and even the far-right media network Infowars have used the concept to push products that promise to better their loyal followers’ lives. And separately, the term has become attached to trends like clean-eating and plant-based movements that say that better lives are those without pollutants like meat or “chemicals.” Both of these are pushed on social media platforms by influencers with large followings and sponsored content posts — Kim Kardashian promoting appetite suppressant lollipops, or British YouTuber Zoella sharing a picture of her side table stacked with premium products, while talking about her sleep routine.Everything shared to an Instagram thread account follows a rigid aesthetic. Andi doesn’t use her own picture for the account or any photos she’s taken herself. Instead, she prefers to use photos lifted from places like We Heart It, Pinterest, or other Instagram accounts. She said she tries her best to credit the sources of her images, or asks specific influencers for permission. A makeup artist called Sarah Paulsun said she was aware Andi had used her image, and she supported her.Andi’s account, like others of the same genre, is littered with images of women with cheeks glistening with highlighter, gripping flowers and embodying a “carefree” vibe. The carousels are photo-heavy and the advice is almost always written out in short sentences or bullet points. Most are prefaced with some sort of cheery disclaimer: “this may or may not work for you! different things work for different people <3”As these accounts have become more popular, more users have been calling them out for misleading and poor-quality content. Also, medical experts are beginning to worry that the advice offered could be doing more harm than good.Dr. Anjali Mahto of the British Association of Dermatologists told BuzzFeed News that she’s actually been sent bad skin-care advice from teenagers on her own Instagram account, despite the fact she’s literally a dermatologist. “I posted a photo and someone asked if I tried cutting gluten,” she said. Mahto said that, more and more, she is seeing people at her clinic who have tried at-home treatments and caused themselves more problems. “It’s the bane of my life,” she said. “Social media is a double-edged sword. Talking about things like mental health is positive; the downside is it can give a voice to some bad ideas.”Mahto said that natural remedies can cause more skin issues, and without proper knowledge of skin care, people are piling more and more trendy products, again causing problems. “These are medical issues; acne, skin problems — they require a medicine from a doctor.” Shai Swecker Strahin told BuzzFeed News that she ended up fighting with fans of self-care accounts. The 22-year-old aesthetician — someone trained to perform beauty treatments such as facial peels and hair removal — from Mebane, North Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that DIY treatments shared on these accounts can cause more harm than good. “So many people say to use coconut oil, lemon, apple cider vinegar, and it’s all so damaging,” she said. “Coconut oil is not a face moisturizer — it just leaves a layer on top of your skin that’s going to clog your pores.”“At the end of the day, if you’re having skin issues, go see a licensed aesthetician to get the correct skin care routine for your skin.” Andi isn’t that concerned about the criticism, however. “I include weight loss tips and others as people direct-message me on Instagram asking for different thread ideas,” she said. “I don't post them to be rude or anything, because I personally don't care about looks but some people want tips, so I post them to help.”Like others who run thread accounts, Andi regularly promotes a cryptocurrency app called Sweatcoin through an affiliate program. The app, which pays users to walk, is popular with influencers, and some have posted screenshots showing themselves making hundreds of dollars off the app. However, Ismael Dahir, the 18-year-old brother of a BuzzFeed reporter, who recently came across the app on social media, told BuzzFeed News that making money from it is difficult due to daily caps and membership fees. A spokesperson for Sweatcoin told BuzzFeed News that its affiliate program is open to those who have successfully invited 30 or more people to the app via social accounts, and are rewarded with a cryptocurrency called sweatcoins. They added that the company takes its public image seriously, and said that if anyone feels Sweatcoin affiliates are making false claims, they should flag these immediately. Andi also makes money promoting smaller Instagram accounts. To get on her Story for 12 hours costs around $6; for 24 hours it’s around $12. To stay on her account permanently via a post, it’s $20. A social media strategist who works with influencers but asked not to be named for professional reasons told BuzzFeed News that influencers with Andi’s following can charge brands over $1,000 for a post. Divyanshi Hazarika, a 16-year-old fashion blogger from Assam, India, paid accounts including Andi’s between $10 and $30 to promote her account. “I really want to be a blogger, so I asked many accounts with a big enough following to give me shoutouts,” she said. Divyanshi, who currently has 2,000 followers, said she is trying to get up to 20,000 followers so she can work with better affiliate programs and grow her account more. Unfortunately, the promotions didn’t give her the growth she wanted and she’s unsure if she’d do it again.“I believe promotions help with creating a bigger audience, and I really need that. I was so desperate that I had to pay,” she said. There are also teens who are inspired by influencers like Andi. Nathan Mclatchie, a 16-year-old from the UK, has 432 followers on his Instagram account moonthreadss. His posts follow the familiar structure of thread accounts: he uses hearts to section off text; he encourages followers to use his promotion code at Shop All Cases, a phone accessories store. Nathan uses hashtags on his account to gain followers, but lacks the comments and interaction you get at Andi’s level. “The effect I wish to have is to teach people to learn to love themselves and step back and realize that there’s no shame in realizing that they may not be okay and need a little bit of a pamper,” he said. Nathan said he doesn’t have much of a system for what he posts, and he aims to create content that will draw “the most attention for the account” as “social media is such a powerful and beautiful place.” Shop All Cases’ owner, 29-year-old Megan Wallis from North Queensland, Australia, said affiliates who work with her company get a 10% commission on all sales through referrals, and receive a free phone case for every five sales. To join, they have to have 2,000 followers or more, and Wallis said there are “other factors.” Andi said that since starting her account last year, she’s made over $5,000 through promotions, but she said she didn’t use anything like promotions to grow her account — it all happened naturally. She said that she does get negative feedback from time to time, but she tries not to read it. Looking through her comments, the responses to Andi’s account appear to be overwhelmingly positive. The posts on her main account average around 2,000–10,000 likes and get hundreds of comments. Her account has become its own community. Teens give one another advice and chat in the comments without her having to create a new post. Followers regularly provide her with content ideas, either by messaging her privately or replying to callouts.“Need ideas for threads,“ Andi posted on June 17, accompanied by a picture of US pop star Madison Beer. Two hundred comments followed, all on a similar theme — skin problems, body fears, DIY beauty advice. “Cute ways to decorate your home on a budget, or how to save money on makeup if that makes any sense,” one user wrote.And fans of the accounts credit these mini-communities with helping them through typical teen issues. Christy Hopper, a 15-year-old from Virginia, told BuzzFeed News that she credits Instagram self-care accounts for helping her with her acne. “I take them seriously. I have struggled with acne for over a year and I go to see if there are any other things I haven’t tried,” she said.Christy said that advice from the accounts has helped with her acne, and that the accounts, for her, are more like a community. She shares advice that has worked for her in comments sections so that others can benefit. “I use them for inspiration and seeing how other people live their lives — maybe take tips from them for my life or maybe give others the same,” she said. But Mahto believes that young people like Christy may be turning to self-care threads due to distrust of or difficulty in accessing traditional medicine. Mahto sees the whole trend as a generation of young people unimpressed by, and possibly unable to receive, proper medical care. “There’s the trend towards natural products, but also there are very few dermatologists in the UK. Some might prefer the quick fix of natural ingredients, have a fear towards traditional medicine, or not be bothered with long general practitioner processes,” said Mahto. Andi said that she doesn’t see her account ending anytime soon. She said she really just wants to help other teenagers. “I started my account as I [had] seen a lot of skin care/self-care threads on my Explore account and they really fascinated me for some reason. I liked the idea of making posts to help people with things that they struggle with (acne, weight and much more) but I also like showing others that everyone is beautiful,” she said. “I love my account and I really don’t know what I would do without it.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/8/5/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-9361-1533721073-1.jpg?crop=1095:574;223,313eab738b0d045422ebcd90374b2fe5303	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		This Cat Loves Peaches So Everybody Now Loves This Cat	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	This Cat Loves Peaches So Everybody Now Loves This Cat	0	"""My mom says it was love at first smell with Ozzy and the peaches,"" she said.

They Won't Say.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Do Senate Republicans Still Think Anita Hill Was Lying? They Won't Say.	0	"WASHINGTON — As senators prepare to hear from Christine Blasey Ford about her accusations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Republican senators who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas 27 years ago won’t talk about Anita Hill, the accuser they didn’t believe in 1991.""That's not a question for today. I'm not going to answer that,” Sen. Orrin Hatch said on Wednesday when asked whether he still thinks Hill lied during her testimony in 1991.Hatch didn’t answer follow-up questions about whether he thought the process then was fair, when witnesses who said they would support Hill’s story were never called to testify. As in 1991, Democrats have pushed for witnesses that Ford says were present when she was assaulted by Kavanaugh to be called to testify under oath, but so far Republicans, including Hatch, have rebuffed those requests.At the time, Hatch said Hill had been “coached by special interest groups” and that her allegations were “too contrived” and “slick.” He has cast similar doubts on Ford’s allegations and those of the two other women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.As recently as 2010, Hatch reiterated that he still thought Hill was lying and said that she should apologize to Thomas and his wife. ""Look, I was there. I know this more intimately than almost anybody,"" he said at the time. ""And I can tell you that Clarence Thomas was telling the truth.""Two other top Republicans, Sen. Chuck Grassley, who currently heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, heard from Hill and voted to confirm Thomas in 1991. This week, they did not respond to questions about whether they think Hill was lying. BuzzFeed News reached out to roughly a dozen staffers who worked on Thomas’s confirmation as well. All of them did not respond or declined to comment.Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, who was a Democrat in 1991 but later switched parties, also voted to confirm Thomas after hearing Hill’s testimony, but he wouldn’t say much about Hill when asked this week if he had changed his mind about her testimony.“I just think the process ought to work. That’s what I thought then. That’s what I say here: You’ve got an accused, you’ve got an accuser. Let the process work. That’s what it’s about,” he said.Their silence on Hill comes despite the fact that her appearance 27 years ago looms over the Kavanaugh confirmation. The journalists Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer, who covered the hearings at the time, wrote a exhaustive investigation into the claims made by both Hill and Thomas at the time, ultimately siding with Hill in their 1994 book Strange Justice.And Hill reemerged as a prominent academic and commentator who now heads a commission on sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and frequently speaks out on the topic — including in a recent New York Times op-ed in support of Ford. And she has continued to gain a following among Democrats who believe her honesty was vindicated long ago.The view on from the conservative movement is the opposite: Thomas has since emerged as conservative hero on the court, a man who survived what he then called a “high-tech lynching.” Top conservatives still don't believe Anita Hill.Indeed, many conservative commentators are drawing parallels between Hill and Ford in recent weeks, suggesting that both women invented allegations to smear conservative judges.Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch and a frequent Fox News guest, told BuzzFeed News both Hill and Ford “are reluctant witnesses, because I don’t think their stories would hold up under too much scrutiny.”“Partisans and leftists, Democrats, have created another mythology. Clarence Thomas is on the Supreme Court because people didn’t believe Anita Hill,” he said.Fitton said he doesn’t think Hill was a credible witness, and that “Clarence Thomas effectively countered her testimony and was supported by the women he worked with.”But he said he thinks that with Ford, “maybe this person believes something happened to her, or something happened to her, and the question is if she’s able to convince anyone credibly that Kavanaugh is behind it. And that’s the hurdle she’s been unable to meet with anything she’s presented so far.”Sean Hannity, a Fox News celebrity and Trump ally, has been comparing the confirmation process for Kavanaugh and Thomas on both his TV show and radio program, making it clear he thinks Thomas was the subject of ""vile"" attacks.""I’ll never forget you know Clarence Thomas having to defend his name and honor, and the absolute viciousness of attacks against him,"" Hannity said in June on his radio show before the allegations against Kavanaugh surfaced.""One of the most powerful moments of testimony I can recall in my lifetime, and one of the most vicious, vile, unfair attacks against any one individual, in Justice Thomas's case, because he happened to be an African American that was a conservative. It was vicious.""He has since continued to defend Kavanaugh, repeatedly drawing parallels between him and Thomas. ""But what you are seeing is a political tactic that we have seen many times,"" Hannity said on his Fox News show last week. ""They did it to Judge Bork. They did it to Judge Clarence Thomas, and now it's Judge Kavanaugh. So, you also have a right to be skeptical.""Ann Coulter in a tweet this week suggested the allegations were lucrative for Hill and could be for Ford as well."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-29299-1538002526-17.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,115bed4082c77b44ff6867ff6a4dc8d9e76	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The House Just Passed A Bill To Prevent Another Death Toll Disaster Like In Puerto Rico	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The House Just Passed A Bill To Prevent Another Death Toll Disaster Like In Puerto Rico	0	"After a year of uncertainty about the real number of people who died as a result of Hurricane Maria, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that aims to create a national standard for how deaths are counted in the aftermath of a disaster.The bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to work with the National Academy of Medicine to study best practices on how to count deaths after disasters, and to come up with policy recommendations for federal agencies.Currently, there are no national standards on what to count as a disaster-related death, just a list of CDC guidelines on how to fill out forms correctly after making that decision.The death toll is a measure of the severity of a disaster and the effectiveness of the response, but it also has direct financial implications for families who lost loved ones who can lose out on some federal assistance if those deaths are not counted.That was true in Puerto Rico, where in the weeks and months after Hurricane Maria, BuzzFeed News and the Puerto Rican Center for Investigative Journalism reported that there were inaccuracies in the death toll. Puerto Ricans who had lost family members both directly and indirectly as a result of the storm said they weren’t being counted in the official death toll. Funeral home and crematorium directors told BuzzFeed News they had received no clear instructions on how or when to report a death they thought was caused by the storm.In December, three months after the hurricane hit, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s administration said that 64 people had died as a result of the storm. The governor and officials in his administration repeatedly denied that there was any problem with their death toll counting at that time.But in August of this year, Roselló finally admitted that his administration’s death toll had been inaccurate because they did not have a clear system for deciding which deaths were hurricane-related during and after the storm. He requested an independent analysis, which was conducted by a team of independent researchers at George Washington University. Last month, the administration updated the death toll to 2,975, based on the GWU estimate.As a result of the initial inaccurate death toll following Hurricane Maria, thousands of Puerto Ricans have no official document confirming that their loved ones died because of the hurricane and are thus losing out on some federal assistance. Earlier this month BuzzFeed News reported that of 2,431 applications for funeral assistance after the storm, just 75 had been approved by FEMA by the end of July.“All this has to be part of this discussion because it’s just not right,” New York Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez, who sponsored the bill, told BuzzFeed News. “How can you think that families are going to go and apply for this kind of federal assistance if they don’t have proof that their relatives died? It’s just one after the other; how much more pain can be inflicted to those who lost loved ones?”The House passed the bill to create standards for disaster-related death tolls on Wednesday, two weeks after President Trump said he doesn’t believe Puerto Rico’s count. “3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,” he tweeted, adding that “This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible.”FEMA director Brock Long also cast doubt on the Puerto Rican governor’s updated death toll. In letters to members of Congress he also repeatedly said that local authorities are the ones who determine death tolls, and that FEMA plays no role in counting deaths. But the bill passed by the House Wednesday would require his agency to help create new standards for doing so.Velázquez said that if the president is going to question the death toll, his administration should also “get FEMA to work in setting up federal standards that will provide accuracy in terms of the death toll after disasters strike, direct and indirect.”Wednesday’s bill was passed after being incorporated into bipartisan legislation to fund the Federal Aviation Administration. It’s likely to pass the Senate easily as well and then head to Trump’s desk for his signature. (A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris in June)."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/the-house-just-passed-a-bill-to-prevent-another-d-2-4068-1538001808-0_dblbig.jpgd17a6d9087014a81aec0619fe0136e48	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Republicans Are Already Planning To Vote On Kavanaugh Next Week, Even Before The Hearing With His Accuser	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Republicans Are Already Planning To Vote On Kavanaugh Next Week, Even Before The Hearing With His Accuser	0	"Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, tweeted Tuesday that he had set up a ""potential"" meeting for Friday, in which they could vote on Kavanaugh's nomination ""if we're ready to vote."" The nomination would then head to the full Senate.Several Republican senators said Tuesday they have been told to be available through the weekend for possible votes on Kavanaugh’s nomination. If the committee votes Friday and the Senate stays in DC, a final confirmation vote could take place as early as next Tuesday.The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to question both Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who alleges he sexually assaulted her when they were in high school, on Thursday.Moving up the vote would also help Republicans in the event Kavanaugh’s nomination gets voted down, by giving them more time to nominate and confirm a replacement before the midterm elections in November.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Tuesday to prepare to stay in DC throughout the weekend, which would fast-track the final vote on a once-safe nomination that has been blown off the rails in recent weeks by daily stories about Kavanaugh’s past.WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans are already laying the groundwork to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by early next week, even though neither of the two women who have made allegations against him have yet testified before Congress.Judic Cmte noticed POTENTIAL exec mtg for Friday. Still taking this 1 step at a time. After hrg Dr Ford & Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony- if we‘re ready to vote, we will vote. If we aren’t ready, we won’t. Cmte rules normally require 3 days notice so we‘re following regular order“I think it’s going to be pretty hard to move this along without having votes on, certainly Friday and Saturday,” said Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, a member of the Judiciary Committee, who said he expects the Senate to be in session through the weekend.McConnell has not said publicly that he is targeting Tuesday, but both parties are looking to next week. McConnell has said repeatedly in recent days that Kavanaugh will be confirmed. He told supporters Friday that Republicans would “plow right through” and put Kavanaugh on the court.“We have set for ourselves at least on the Republican side October 1, and October 1 is the date for the new term of the Supreme Court. I don’t know if we will make it but I hope we will get close to it,” said Republican Sen. John Kennedy.While Democratic senators are expected to question Ford and Kavanaugh directly, Republicans are bringing in a woman lawyer to do their questioning instead of the 11 male GOP members who sit on the committee. Grassley has not identified the lawyer and said her identity will likely not be known until the day of the hearings.“We have done it because we want to de-politicize the whole process like the Democrats politicized the Anita Hill thing. The whole purpose is to create an environment where it’s what Dr. Ford has asked for, that it be professional and not be a circus,” said Grassley.Certain details of the hearing, such as how much time senators will have to question Ford and Kavanaugh, remain unsettled.There is currently no plan for the committee to hear from Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s who told the New Yorker he exposed himself to her at a party. Several Republican senators said this week they were not concerned about voting on Kavanaugh without hearing from Ramirez first.“I felt more strongly about the first accuser [Ford], for her to be heard. But the second one, I don’t know, it just seemed a lot looser and the people who were supposedly there didn’t remember,” said Republican Sen. Bob Corker.Ramirez, Ford, and Democrats have all called for the FBI to investigate the Kavanaugh allegations. But that appears to be going nowhere. Grassley instead opted to have committee staff interview witnesses via phone. While Democrats have pushed for calling those witnesses to testify under oath, Grassley’s office rebutted this by saying it would still be a crime to have lied to committee staffers."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/republicans-are-already-planning-to-vote-on-kavan-2-3771-1537916157-4_dblbig.jpg8f11b001a1604a3aaf8162f87a644313	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		On The Anniversary Of Hurricane Maria, The Trump Administration Doesn’t Acknowledge The Thousands Who Died In Puerto Rico	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	On The Anniversary Of Hurricane Maria, The Trump Administration Doesn’t Acknowledge The Thousands Who Died In Puerto Rico	0	"President Donald Trump meeting with Gov. Ricardo Rosselló in Puerto Rico nearly two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit.White House officials visited Puerto Rico on Thursday to help commemorate the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, but made no mention of the nearly 3,000 people who died in the storm’s wake — a death toll that the president has openly questioned.On Thursday, HUD Secretary Ben Carson visited the island along with FEMA and White House officials to discuss the recovery efforts.“On behalf of the president the vice president and this entire administration, I want to begin by thanking the government for working so incredibly hard,” Carson said at a press conference in San Juan with Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. “Today is really a time to reflect on how we have pulled together as one, island and the mainland alike.”Last week, President Trump said repeatedly that he does not believe the Puerto Rican government’s official death toll, which they updated after months of media reports and scientific studies indicated that their original number was off by several thousand.“3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,” Trump tweeted. He added that “This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible.”Rosselló admitted last month that approximately 2,975 Puerto Ricans died because of the hurricane, after saying for months that only 64 people had died.FEMA director Brock Long continued to echo Trump’s doubts that thousands of people had not died when he appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press and Fox News Sunday over the weekend.Representing the administration on the one year anniversary in Puerto Rico, Carson did not mention the lives lost because of the storm. A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on whether Carson agrees with the president’s position on the death toll.Earlier in the day, the White House released a statement touting the administration’s “Historic Recovery Effort,” calling it “the largest and longest Federal response to a disaster in the history of the United States.”During his visit, Carson signed an agreement with Rosselló to release $1.5 billion of $7.4 billion in disaster recovery grants approved by Trump last September for all of the major hurricanes that hit the US in 2017. Those grants will go toward housing repairs, rental assistance, small business grants, and rebuilding infrastructure.In November, Rosselló asked Congress for $94.4 billion in recovery funds. He said $19 billion would be required to rebuild the island’s electric grid alone."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/20/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/sub-buzz-15166-1537477511-6.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230cb70770432c14b75a75db1e8e5dbbedc	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		12 Million Bottles Of Water Were Abandoned For Months In Hurricane-Ravaged Puerto Rico	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	12 Million Bottles Of Water Were Abandoned For Months In Hurricane-Ravaged Puerto Rico	0	"In the months that the water appears to have been on the runway starting in January, most people had running water on the island, though for many it was still sporadic .Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, leaving residents without gas, power, or potable water for months. At one point, nearly 1.5 million people had no access to drinking water , forcing some to drink unsafe water from creeks and rivers.Confusion about how such a massive miscalculation and subsequent handling of the water began Tuesday when photos of the bottled water were posted on Facebook. Public outrage was swift as US government agencies avoided taking responsibility for the wasted water.Justo Hernández, deputy federal coordinating officer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told reporters that the 19,841 pallets of water were left on the runway at José Aponte de la Torre Airport and that as a result, “some of that water was spoiled.”The US government on Thursday acknowledged that roughly 12 million bottles of water were left exposed to the elements on an airport runway in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico for months, confirming for the first time the scale of the blunder.Children fill up bottles with water at a water distribution point in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria on Sept. 24, 2017.An employee for the United Forces of Rapid Action agency of the Puerto Rico Police told CBS News he first saw the bottles in the fall of 2017, but only recently posted the pictures on Facebook because he was angry they were still there.Hernández said that in January, FEMA had identified “an excess of water on the island” and began storing it at the airport. But it wasn’t until April that Puerto Rico’s General Services Administration took custody of the pallets of water.In a statement, the General Services administrator, Ottmar Chávez, said that after his workers began delivering the water, they received complaints about the “smell and taste of the water.”“Based on those complaints, we contacted FEMA to return the water to the federal GSA inventory,” Chávez said.Hernández stressed that, despite the complaints, there have been no reports of people becoming sick from food or water that has been distributed by the emergency agencies.He added that while the water continued to be stored for months out in the open at the airport, officials tried to rotate older pallets with new shipments as they came in. As older pallets were delivered to local jurisdictions, the newly delivered pallets were placed on the runway, he said.Despite the additional details, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Thursday he wants FEMA to explicitly say his administration was not responsible for the water.“It’s important to say that when that news came out, a FEMA spokesperson pointed to the government of Puerto Rico as if they were responsible for this water on the runway,” he said. “However, with the evidence after conducting part of an investigation, the story is different. We’re already seeing that FEMA is starting to acknowledge their responsibility for this water.”He also pointed to satellite photos that he said showed FEMA had started placing the water on the runway in January, but that the agency did not make it clear to other agencies it was available until several months later, when the bottles were already sun-damaged.Salvador Hernandez contributed reporting to this story."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/13/17/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/12-million-bottles-of-water-were-abandoned-for-mo-2-5517-1536873009-0_dblbig.jpg51f4b02435e645959a52ece5ec0f28c6	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The Trump Administration Transferred Millions Of Dollars From FEMA To ICE Ahead Of Hurricane Season	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The Trump Administration Transferred Millions Of Dollars From FEMA To ICE Ahead Of Hurricane Season	0	"FEMA Administrator Brock Long listens as President Trump speaks during a meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in the Oval Office on Sept. 11.As North Carolina braces for a Category 4 hurricane and Puerto Rico still struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, documents show that the Trump administration transferred millions of dollars in funds from the federal disaster response agency to immigration enforcement.The document, titled ""Department of Homeland Security FY 2018 Transfer and Reprogramming Notifications"" was first reported by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and obtained by Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.It shows that DHS, which oversees both the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), transferred $9.8 million from FEMA to ICE.Those funds are marked as being transferred to ICE for ""enforcement and removal operations"" and ""protective operations.""""Without the transfers and reprogramming identified in this notification, ICE will not be able to fulfill its adult detention requirements in FY 2018,"" the document says. ""Insufficient funding could require ICE to release any new book-ins and illegal border violators. ICE will not be able to deport those who have violated immigration laws. ICE could also be forced to reduce its current interior enforcement operations, curtailing criminal alien and fugitive arrests.""Funds were also transferred to ICE from other agencies including the Transportation Security Administration and the US Coast Guard, the document says.The document goes on to say that, to compensate for the cuts, FEMA would cut down on ""training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and IT investments in the legacy grants systems for transition to the Grants Management Modernization Program.""Tyler Houlton, a spokesperson for DHS, denied that the funds were taken from disaster relief funds in a statement on Twitter.""Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts,"" Houlton said in a tweet. ""This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.""Houlton went on to say that the money transferred to ICE from FEMA ""could not have been used for hurricane response due to appropriation limitations.""The documents, however, show that the transferred amounts include $332,999 from disaster recovery, $1.9 million from disaster response, and $2.1 million from preparedness and protection funds. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Houlton for clarification and further details but did not immediately receive a response.The transfer is a small portion of FEMA's overall $15.5 billion budget. The disaster relief agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/12/5/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/the-trump-administration-transferred-millions-of--2-5549-1536745170-4_dblbig.jpg56d66efedbc44698af37f84a6e09d831	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		More Than 2,000 Puerto Ricans Applied For Funeral Assistance After Hurricane Maria. FEMA Approved Just 75.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	More Than 2,000 Puerto Ricans Applied For Funeral Assistance After Hurricane Maria. FEMA Approved Just 75.	0	"FEMA approved just 3% of applications for funeral assistance from more than 2,000 Puerto Rican families who lost loved ones after Hurricane Maria, according to a letter the agency head wrote to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.In response to an earlier letter from Warren, Brock Long, director of FEMA, wrote on Aug. 14 that as of July 30, his agency had received 2,431 requests for funeral assistance from Puerto Ricans related to the hurricane — they approved just 75 of them, meaning 97% have either been rejected or have not received a decision almost a year after Maria hit the island.FEMA's funeral assistance is intended to help people who have lost loved ones in disaster situations pay for funeral costs, including caskets, mortuary services, burial plots, and cremations.Although Long did not give a specific reason in his letter for the rejections, he pointed to FEMA’s requirements for funeral assistance. To qualify, Puerto Ricans had to provide a death certificate or letter from a government official ""that clearly indicates the death was attributed to the emergency or disaster, either directly or indirectly,” Long wrote in the letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, which he wrote on behalf of FEMA and the Department of Health and Human Services.But getting that information was impossible for many families because, as the Puerto Rican government recently admitted, officials were not counting hurricane-related deaths correctly.Two weeks ago Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló admitted that authorities vastly undercounted how many people were dying because of the hurricane, partly because they failed to provide clear instructions to doctors and funeral homes on how death certificates should be filled out.He updated the official death count from 64 to an estimated 2,975 people, after months of insistence in the immediate aftermath of the storm that there were no errors.FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they plan to reconsider applications for funeral assistance in light of the updated death toll. HHS also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Even now, families whose loved ones died because of the hurricane but weren’t initially counted still won’t have updated death certificates or letters from the government to send to FEMA, because the updated death toll is just an estimate. Researchers at George Washington University, tasked by the Puerto Rican governor to reassess the death toll, did not individually examine each death that occurred during and after the hurricane. Individual death certificates and records have not been reviewed or updated.“It should be a gut punch to all of us that thousands of our fellow U.S. citizens died due to Hurricane Maria and its aftermath. For months, I’ve pushed the Trump Administration about its role in, and acceptance of, an inaccurate fatality count,"" Warren told BuzzFeed News in a statement. ""We need to know how the Administration has updated its disaster planning in response to the new death toll and ensure that grieving Puerto Rican families receive long-awaited federal funeral assistance.”In the weeks after the hurricane, FEMA did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the inaccuracies in the death count when BuzzFeed News flagged them, including how that could affect people seeking funeral assistance.Funeral home and crematorium directors told BuzzFeed News soon after the hurricane that they were seeing an increase in people asking for cremations rather than burials for their loved ones, in large part because people were worried about burial costs, and cremations are less expensive, they said.Long wrote several times in his letter to Democrats last month that FEMA has no responsibility in making sure hurricane-related deaths are being classified correctly. ""The determination of cause and manner of death is the sole responsibility of the state or territory's cause-of-death certifier,"" he wrote.On Monday, Warren and 21 other Democrats in Congress sent another letter to FEMA, asking whether the agency and HHS accept the updated death toll, how they plan to make sure Puerto Ricans receive the assistance they should have gotten, and pushing back on the agency's position that it is not responsible for the death toll.“What that response overlooks is that accurately counting disaster-related fatalities is inextricably linked to supporting survivors and establishing resilience and preparedness,"" the Democrats wrote.""Given the near-certainty that many Puerto Ricans eligible for funeral assistance have not received it, and given the obvious need for many bodies to be claimed for proper burial or cremation, what is FEMA doing to expedite the funeral assistance process?"" they asked in the letter.Democrats also asked FEMA whether they plan to reassess how they responded to Hurricane Maria, and whether they will change their disaster preparedness plans accordingly. The letter comes as Hurricane Florence barrels toward the Carolinas.“The Trump administration utterly failed the people of Puerto Rico, and we have to make sure what happened there never happens again. We’re in the midst of a potentially devastating hurricane season, and FEMA needs accurate statistics to deal with upcoming crises,"" Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who cosigned the letter, told BuzzFeed News. ""Puerto Rico needs to keep receiving the funding it needs to fully recover, and we must revisit the process we use to ensure an accurate death toll after natural disasters.”In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA contracted Kenyon International, a company which specializes in recovering and identifying remains after disasters. The company was contracted by neither FEMA nor Puerto Rican authorities after Hurricane Maria.The company’s CEO, Robert Jensen, warned in October that families who lost loved ones could lose out on federal assistance because of the lack of clarity and apparent discrepancies in the death toll, as first reported by the Puerto Rican Center for Investigative Journalism and BuzzFeed News.He said given the lack of updated death certificates, FEMA could issue a guidance saying they will consider applications for deaths that occurred within a set time frame during and after the hurricane, of causes that could be linked to the hurricane. Another alternative, he said, could be for Congress to amend the program to allow people to receive aid without needing the death certificate or letter.“It’s just one more thing that makes it harder for people. I don’t think it’s about FEMA not wanting to pay but it’s part of the bureaucracy and not understanding the emotional impact this has,” he said. “You spent money for a loved one who died.”In Monday's letter, Democrats asked FEMA and HHS whether implementing new federal disaster death toll counting standards could lead to more accurate death counts and potentially fewer deaths as disasters unfold.FEMA and HHS did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment on whether they plan to develop federal guidelines on how to count disaster-related deaths.The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, President Donald Trump called the federal response to Hurricane Maria “an incredible unsung success.”“I think Puerto Rico was incredibly successful. Puerto Rico was actually our toughest one of all because it is an island,” he said, responding to a question about what lessons on disaster response his administration could take from last year."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/11/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/more-than-2000-puerto-ricans-applied-for-funeral--2-10167-1536706205-10_dblbig.jpg9027b1cf02da4f4884ed8c49d3325a52	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		"Comedian Drew Michael Doesn't Regret Using The Word ""Faggot"" In A 2011 Blog Post"	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	"Comedian Drew Michael Doesn't Regret Using The Word ""Faggot"" In A 2011 Blog Post"	0	"Comedian Drew Michael won't say he regrets using the word ""faggot"" in a 2011 blog post but said that he has since deleted the post and ""grown past"" using the word. Speaking to host Audie Cornish on Profile, BuzzFeed News' interview show on Facebook Watch, Michael responded to a question about a post he wrote to give advice to young aspiring comedians in which he wrote, ""Don't be a faggot.""""Obviously what I meant was don't be, like, don't be a loser, or don't complain, don't whine,"" he said.""And in doing that I used that word instead of 'loser' and I actually took the blog down from my own website because I thought the whole thing was something that, I don't want this up,"" he said. ""So not even because of one particular thing, I was like, I don't stand by it. I've grown past this whole thing, including the word in question.""Pushed on whether he has regrets about writing ""Don't be a faggot,"" Michael said, ""It's hard to say 'regret,' because I said it.""Michael went on to say that he thinks ""it's okay to be wrong"" when speaking in ""the arts space,"" including stage shows, podcasts, and interview shows.""The stage especially — when I say something on stage, I don't even necessarily believe everything that I'm saying. It's a way to experiment with what I actually believe,"" he said. Michael said he doesn't believe people should be held accountable for everything they said or wrote in the past, and that people's careers should not be affected by things they said years ago. ""I mean Leslie Jones was just on The View talking about this ... She said, like, I'm so glad social media didn't exist when I was in my twenties because the stuff I was saying was crazy. And it's like, yeah,"" he said.He added that he thinks holding people accountable for things they said 10 years ago, for example, is ""anti-human, anti-art, anti-life.

They were the first players of the 2018 season to continue the protests that began two years ago. Their teammate Robert Quinn raised a fist during the song. Stills and Wilson had also taken a knee during a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons in August.Colin Kaepernick — the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who started the NFL protest movement and who last week was presented as the face of Nike's 30th anniversary ""Just Do It"" campaign for his advocacy — tweeted his support for the Dolphins players Sunday. ""They have not backed down, even when attacked and intimidated. Their courage will move the world forward!"" he wrote.My Brothers @kstills and @ithinkisee12 continue to show their unwavering strength by fighting for the oppressed! They have not backed down, even when attacked and intimidated. Their courage will move the world forward! “Love is at the root of our resistance!”✊🏾 https://t.co/2kSsX4s7EUThe NFL’s own rules on the protests remain unresolved. Earlier in the summer, team owners put in place a new policy banning players from kneeling during the anthem — but allowing them to remain in the locker room. The NFL Players Association filed a grievance against the policy, and it’s been on hold since July. An NFL official told ESPN on Sunday morning that there would be no rule explicitly banning or allowing the protests issued this season.While Stills and Wilson were the only players who kneeled, 49ers receiver Marquise Goodwin also raised his fist while the anthem played before his team's game Sunday, as did Los Angeles Chargers left tackle Russell Okung. Denver Broncos players Demaryius Thomas and Brandon Marshall and Seahawks players Duane Brown and Quinton Jefferson stayed in their teams' tunnels during the anthem Sunday.President Donald Trump criticized the players’ protests throughout the NFL season last year and has continued his attacks at rallies and on Twitter.Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!In the season opener Thursday night, the Atlanta Falcons played the Philadelphia Eagles. None of the players kneeled, raised their fists, or stayed in the locker room, but the Eagles’ Michael Bennett sat down on a bench toward the end of the national anthem. As Thursday’s game kicked off, the Players Association, a coalition of players who lobbied the NFL to contribute to social justice advocacy groups, tweeted: “Today, football is back. But, on any given night, over 450,000 people sit in jail w/o being convicted of a crime. Many are there because they can’t purchase their freedom with cash bail.”Today, football is back.

On Sunday, Trump tweeted about Thursday’s lower ratings, claiming they were related to the players’ protests, though no players protested during the opener. “If the players stood proudly for our Flag and Anthem, and it is all shown on broadcast, maybe ratings could come back? Otherwise worse!” he wrote.Wow, NFL first game ratings are way down over an already really bad last year comparison. Viewership declined 13%, the lowest in over a decade. If the players stood proudly for our Flag and Anthem, and it is all shown on broadcast, maybe ratings could come back? Otherwise worse!Several NFL team owners have rebuked Trump for his attacks on the players, especially after he said at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, last year that owners should fire any “son of a bitch” who kneels during the national anthem. In September, reporters asked Trump if he was stoking racial tensions by targeting the players’ protest of racism and police brutality. He denied that the protests are related to race. “This has nothing to do with race. I never said anything about race. This has nothing to do with race or anything else. This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag,” Trump said. The protests began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, kneeled during the anthem at several games in protest of police brutality against people of color. “I’m not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he told NFL Media in August 2016. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder,” he said. Nike took a stance on the issue before the season began, highlighting Kaepernick and his activism in an ad campaign."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/9/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-29659-1536514408-5.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,229861fc22bbd6a43f784d79064bdc1ff29	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Trump Says He Did A “Fantastic Job” In Puerto Rico — The Day After It Was Revealed Nearly 3,000 People Died	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Trump Says He Did A “Fantastic Job” In Puerto Rico — The Day After It Was Revealed Nearly 3,000 People Died	0	"The day after Puerto Rican authorities acknowledged that 2,975 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria, President Donald Trump told reporters his administration “did a fantastic job” there after the storm.“I think, Puerto Rico, we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico. We are still helping in Puerto Rico. The governor is an excellent guy and he is very happy with the job we've done,” Trump told reporters in the West Wing on Wednesday afternoon.On Tuesday, a study commissioned by Puerto Rico’s Gov. Ricardo Rosselló was published by George Washington University after months of criticism over the inaccuracy of the official death toll.Researchers estimated that 2,975 people died from September to February during the hurricane and in the months after, according to the study, while medical facilities struggled and millions of people lived without clean water, electricity, and reliable cellphone connections.In his comments Wednesday, Trump went on to say, falsely, that electricity on the island was “gone before the hurricane.”“We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico. And it was a very tough one, don’t forget, their electric plant was dead before the hurricane,” he said. “If you look back on your records, you’ll see that the plant was dead and was shut. It was bankrupt. It was out of business. They owed tremendous amounts of money, they had it closed up. And then when the hurricane came, people said, what are we going to do about electricity? That was not the hurricane, that was gone before the hurricane.”While it is true that PREPA, Puerto Rico’s power company, was $9 billion in debt and the island’s infrastructure was already fragile, Puerto Rico did have electricity before hurricanes Irma and Maria wiped out the island’s power lines and shut down the system completely. Full power was just restored to the island earlier this month, 11 months after Maria.Two weeks after the hurricane, Trump visited Puerto Rico and took a walking tour of a neighborhood in Guaynabo that suffered relatively minor damage compared to the rest of the island.During his visit he said Hurricane Maria was not a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina, specifically referring to the official death toll, which at that point stood at 16 people.“Sixteen people certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said at the time. “You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud.”Puerto Rico’s governor and local leaders, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, expressed frustration with the federal response from the US Army Corps and FEMA in the aftermath of the hurricane.A Politico investigation found that Houston received more aid faster after Hurricane Harvey than Puerto Rico received following Hurricane Maria.According to the report, nine days after Hurricane Harvey, FEMA had approved $141.8 million in individual assistance to Harvey victims, compared to $6.2 million for Maria victims in the same time frame. During those first nine days, FEMA provided 5.1 million meals, 4.5 million liters of water, and more than 20,000 tarps to Houston. They provided 1.6 million meals, 2.8 million liters of water, and around 5,000 tarps to Puerto Rico.The GWU study published Tuesday also criticized the lack of federal standards for counting disaster-related deaths, which contributed to the confusion over how many people were dying because of storm-related conditions, something experts warned about in the weeks after the storm, when discrepancies in the death toll were first reported."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/29/16/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/trump-says-he-did-a-fantastic-job-in-puerto-rico--2-27446-1535575088-7_dblbig.jpgf82782005fda4e32ae6aa891838b82a9	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Puerto Rico Changed The Hurricane Maria Death Toll From 64 To Nearly 3,000 People	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Puerto Rico Changed The Hurricane Maria Death Toll From 64 To Nearly 3,000 People	0	"Researchers also found residents weren’t adequately prepared and that doctors were confused about how to classify the dead.Ramon Espinosa / AP Police lift the coffin of fellow officer Luis Angel Gonzalez Lorenzo, who was killed while trying to cross a river in his car during Hurricane Maria.Puerto Rico raised the official death toll for Hurricane Maria from 64 to nearly 3,000 people after months of denying there was an issue with the count. The revision came after an independent study — commissioned by Puerto Rican authorities in January after months of media reports calling their figures into question — was published, pegging the estimated death toll at 2,975 people. By comparison, the death toll for Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, was 1,833. The report published Tuesday by researchers with the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University also found that Puerto Rico did not adequately prepare residents for Maria, which obliterated the island in September 2017, and that doctors were confused about how to classify the dead.Carlos Giusti / AP Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo RossellóPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who in June was forced by a court to disclose complete death statistics, told reporters Tuesday that he accepted responsibility for any shortcomings. “I am the governor of Puerto Rico … the buck stops here so I assume whatever responsibility comes my way,” he said. “Regarding processes, there are many stakeholders involved in this, but I am the governor and I am subject to criticism.” The latest report did not explore each individual death that could have been caused by the Category 4 storm. Instead, researchers came up with an estimate by comparing the total number of deaths in the months after the hurricane to the average for those months in previous years.Until Tuesday, the low death count remained in flux even as studies by Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania put the estimates at 5,740 and nearly 1,200, respectively.And two weeks after the hurricane, President Trump said during a short visit to the island that Maria was not a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina because the death toll at the time was just 16 people.Evan Vucci / AP President Trump tosses paper towels into a crowd in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 3, 2017.“Sixteen people certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump said at the time. “You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud.” A BuzzFeed News analysis of data eventually released by Puerto Rico showed that by Oct. 4, the day Trump visited Puerto Rico, 550 more people had died than what was normal in those two weeks the year before.Soon after he left, officials increased the toll to 34. In a statement Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Trump administration continued to support Rosselló’s efforts “to ensure a full accountability and transparency” of the fatalities resulting from the hurricane, adding that “the American people, including those grieving the loss of a loved one, deserve no less.” “The president remains proud of all the work the federal family undertook to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico,” she said.The report also found that more people died in lower-income communities after the hurricane, though all regions of the island experienced an increased number of deaths.“The risk of death was 45% higher and persistent until the end of the studyperiod for populations living in low socioeconomic development municipalities,” the authors wrote. Researchers also determined that emergency plans at the time were not designed for a storm greater than Category 1, and that doctors did not have clear instructions from the government on how to certify hurricane-related deaths. “I think there are many many people in society that are responsible for planning and response and I see a breakdown in many other systems even before the hurricane,” said Lynn R. Goldman, head of the Milken Institute.Carlos Giusti / AP Electricity poles and lines lie on the road after Hurricane Maria, Sept. 20, 2017.In the weeks following the hurricane, BuzzFeed News and Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism published accounts of dozens of uncounted deaths based on interviews with funeral home directors, doctors, and families who had lost loved ones.Crematorium directors also told BuzzFeed News officials had given them permission to cremate the bodies of dozens more hurricane victims. The government then admitted that 911 potential victims had been cremated without being examined in the five weeks after Maria. At the time, Rosselló told BuzzFeed News the official death count had taken into account “people that died, directly, because of the storm, or indirectly, so, it is important to state that we are going beyond what is asked for.”In response to findings on Tuesday, Rosselló announced he will form a commission to implement the recommendations from the GWU report and others on “public safety and public health care responses.” He also plans to create a registry of vulnerable populations, such as people who need dialysis and those with diabetes. The government will also commission a memorial for the hurricane victims.Ramon Espinosa / AP Angel Rodriguez with his belongings in front of his house, destroyed by Hurricane Maria, on Sept. 30, 2017."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/28/20/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/puerto-rico-changed-the-hurricane-maria-death-tol-2-31718-1535502346-1_dblbig.jpg1315ba29277b46909b5e2301c36484b8	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		A Comedian Apologized After Students At Purdue University Accused Him Of Sexually Harassing A Student During His Routine	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	A Comedian Apologized After Students At Purdue University Accused Him Of Sexually Harassing A Student During His Routine	0	"Several students tweeted after the show that the comedian had ""sexually harassed"" the student during the act, prompting a response from two of the university's offices.Several students walked out of an orientation week performance by Gross Saturday night, protesting a part of the show that they said was lewd and inappropriately targeted a student participant from the audience.""Andy Gross is profoundly sorry that students at Purdue University were offended during his show this past weekend,"" read a statement from Gross. ""Andy was oblivious and naive about the current environment on college campuses, and he sincerely regrets causing any offense or discomfort to any student participating.""In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the comedian apologized for his show, but maintained that he had performed the same bit at multiple venues without being accused of sexual misconduct.Comedian Andy Gross said he was ""oblivious and naive"" that part of his show would be considered lewd and inappropriate, and said he would no longer perform in college campuses after students at Purdue University walked out during one of his performances Saturday night.I am still in shock over what just happened. At Purdue’s BGR closing ceremonies, magician/comedian Andy Gross sexually harassed a girl on stage leaving her in tears afterward. @jimmyfallon do not have this man on your show.Seeing the Class of 2022 and BGR staff take a stand against Andy Gross's disgusting ""performance"" makes me proud to be a Boilermaker. Sexual harassment/assault is not a joke and will NEVER be tolerated. #AndyGrossIsGrossIf anyone saw the show at Purdue tonight, I hope that you can join me in boycotting Andy gross. We need to recognize sexual harassment for what it is and not let it go unpunished. No means no no matter where you are and who is watching. #AndyGrossIsGrossStudents told BuzzFeed News the comedian was performing as a closing act at the school's Boiler Gold Rush orientation week. At one point during the Saturday show, he picked a student leader out of the crowd to be a volunteer and asked her to stand directly in front of him before making a joke about his genitals, according to students who were in the audience.""He insisted the woman from the crowd keep inching closer and he proceeded to do a voice throwing technique while staring down at his midsection, saying, 'Let me out of here!' insinuating his penis was talking to the girl,"" Jeff Terpstra, a sophomore who was in the audience, told BuzzFeed News on Sunday.Terpstra said the performer then made the student stand back to back with him and told her to ""get closer, like cheek to cheek"" before instructing her to put her hand on his thigh while he did a card trick.""He then purposely failed the card trick and said, 'Well, at least I got a free feel-up out of it,'"" Terpstra said.In a statement, a representative for Gross said he had performed the same routine at the Laugh Factory, the Comedy Store, the Improv, and dozens of other venues in the country.""Andy has never before been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment,"" the statement read. ""Again, Andy Gross sincerely regrets causing offense or discomfort.""Gross, his representative said, would be changing parts of his routine that upset students.In a letter to students on Sunday afternoon, the executive director of Purdue's Student Success Programs, Dan Carpenter, apologized for Gross's performance, telling students, ""I share your outrage at the way he interacted with and spoke to students during his act.""Two other students recounted the same actions to BuzzFeed News. Matthew Bryn, a freshman, added that Gross then made a joke about Matt Lauer, the former NBC host who was fired over accusations of sexual assault and harassment.Bryn said he was especially disturbed by the routine because there were several events and speeches throughout the week before highlighting Purdue's ""free zone,"" which encourages treating people with respect and acknowledging their experiences.""It’s just ridiculous, especially [after] having 'free zone' speeches all week. Purdue did send out a notice to all the team leaders ... that said that they in no way supported it,"" Bryn said. ""But I feel like they could have done more. They could have shut his mic [off] or pulled him [off] stage but instead they let him keep going.""A spokesperson for the college told BuzzFeed News in a statement on Sunday that Purdue does not condone the comedian's routine and will not be working with him again in the future.""Some portions of the performance were clearly inappropriate and contrary to the university’s values of respect and support for all,"" the statement said. ""We will not work with this comedian again and are proud of our students who are standing up and voicing their concerns about the performance.""Another freshman, Amanda Bolen, told BuzzFeed News that she doesn't blame the school, and that the student leaders at the event and her resident adviser were apologetic during and after the event.""I’m hopeful for this university/generation because of how many people walked out in protest. People realizing this is wrong proves that efforts to spreading awareness about sexual assault are working. Andy is just a pig who is making jokes that were probably 'funny' when he was in college,"" she said.Purdue's Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education, which is overseen by the school's dean of students, tweeted immediately after the performance and offered counseling and support services to students. The office said it had been received comments about the performance, which ""was described as [being] harassing and offensive."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/20/22/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/a-comedian-apologized-after-students-at-purdue-un-2-28084-1534820078-0_dblbig.jpg9345ea93986f4f36b54073e2f6db49f8	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Puerto Rico Has Finally Acknowledged That Over 1,400 People Likely Died Because Of Hurricane Maria	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Puerto Rico Has Finally Acknowledged That Over 1,400 People Likely Died Because Of Hurricane Maria	0	"The US territory's government has for months kept the official death toll at 64, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary.Alvin Baez / Reuters A woman stands among hundreds of pairs of shoes displayed at the Capitol to pay tribute to Hurricane Maria's victims.The Puerto Rican government on Thursday acknowledged for the first time that the death toll from Hurricane Maria is likely more than 1,400 people instead of the initial estimate of 64. The figure was included in a 400-page draft report to Congress titled Transformation and Innovation in the Wake of Devastation, under a section related to hurricane damage. However, the Puerto Rican government said it is waiting on the findings of a George Washington University investigation before updating the official death toll. The new estimate was first reported by the New York Times and was included in a draft to Congress outlining a $139 billion plan to reconstruct the US territory's infrastructure which was devastated by hurricanes Maria and Irma. Many residents had to get by without power for months.Gerald Herbert / AP Marta Sostre Vazquez reacts as she starts to wade into the San Lorenzo Morovis river with her family on Sept. 27, 2017, after the bridge was swept away by Hurricane Maria.In the first weeks after the hurricane, Puerto Rico insisted only 64 deaths could be directly attributed to Hurricane Maria, even as families and funeral directors in at least two towns told BuzzFeed News that dozens of deaths directly linked to the storm were not being included in the government's tally.BuzzFeed News also found that 911 possible hurricane victims were cremated without the government's permission and without being examined to see if their deaths were caused by the storm. Still, during a visit to the island to survey the damage, President Donald Trump used the relatively low official death toll — which was then at 16 people — as a measure of how Puerto Rico had not experienced a “real catastrophe” akin to what New Orleans suffered following Hurricane Katrina.Evan Vucci / AP President Trump tosses paper towels into a crowd at Calvary Chapel in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 3, 2017.""You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together,"" he said.

But in the draft report published on Thursday, Puerto Rico acknowledges that the death toll ""appears to be much higher"" than previously estimated:Although the official death count from the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety was initially 64, the toll appears to be much higher. On June 13, the Government of Puerto Rico revealed that there were 1,427 more deaths in the four months after the hurricanes than normal (based on the previous four years), and it will update the official count after a George Washington University study is completed. The report also acknowledges other research into the death toll, including a Harvard study that estimates it may be up to 8,500 because damaged infrastructure made it difficult for people to access health care. It does not, however, explain why the death toll appears to be much higher than the official count, which Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's administration defended as being an accurate figure for months after the hurricane. In June, the government simply released statistics showing an increase of 1,427 more deaths than what was normal in previous years in the four months after the hurricanes, but did not link these deaths to Hurricane Maria.Ramon Espinosa / AP Police lift the coffin of a fellow officer, who was killed during Hurricane Maria when he tried to cross a river in his car, on Sept. 29, 2017."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/9/14/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/puerto-rico-has-finally-acknowledged-that-over-14-2-5500-1533839796-0_dblbig.jpg7fac0ff897eb4c4aa0eda3d233d5ed27	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Asylum-Seekers Held In A Federal Prison Say They're Being Denied Religious Freedoms	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Asylum-Seekers Held In A Federal Prison Say They're Being Denied Religious Freedoms	0	"Asylum-seekers being held at a federal prison in Sheridan, Oregon, are being denied access to religious items and time and space for prayers, according to the Oregon public defender's office.The public defender, Lisa Hay, filed lawsuits on behalf of dozens of asylum-seekers at the Sheridan Federal Correctional Institution on Thursday, alleging that prison authorities are denying detainees, many of whom are Sikh and Hindu, religious accommodations.""The Sikh detainees have not been allowed to wear turbans and instead have either been uncovered or forced to make do with towels, t-shirts, hats, or other inadequate coverings,"" wrote William Teesdale, chief investigator for the public defender's office, in the lawsuit. He added that Hindu detainees have not been given access to their sacred texts in Hindi.The asylum-seekers are part of a group of 123 men originally transferred to the federal prison by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement on May 31 after being taken into custody at the southern border. They are from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and other countries.Thursday's filing is the latest in a series of legal actions taken by the public defender and the ACLU of Oregon on behalf of the asylum-seekers, who they say were held with the general population of the prison and denied access to lawyers for nearly a month after they were moved there.The Federal Bureau of Prisons said Friday it had no comment on the habeas corpus petitions or subsequent filings.A spokesperson for ICE told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that 110 ICE detainees remained in the prison; nine were relocated to be deported, and four were transferred out to the Northwest Detention Center to receive specialized medical care.The detainees were were among 1,600 asylum-seekers moved to federal prisons at the end of May, when ICE said that immigration detention centers were at capacity after the implementation of the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy at the border. In an earlier court filing, an adviser to the Sheridan prison warden said officials were told just one day before the move that they would be receiving around 130 ICE detainees.An ICE spokesperson told BuzzFeed News the agency does not comment on pending litigation.""The detainees express anguish in response to several significant limitations imposed by BOP staff and policies,"" Teesdale wrote in an affidavit, including being forced to pray in their prison cells next to an open toilet and in a space also used as a barbershop where hair is cut, which goes against Sikh practices.The men are not allowed by prison guards to remove their shoes during prayers, had religiously significant items confiscated by Customs and Border Protection when they arrived in the US, and prison guards remove even their makeshift head coverings while they're praying, according to the lawsuit.Lawyers have been able to meet with the men since June 26, the day after a court ordered the Bureau of Prisons and ICE to allow them access — but for weeks leading up to that lawsuit, lawyers were denied access.""We were turned away multiple times by Bureau of Prisons staff. We submitted a letter to the warden of the BOP Sheridan facility as well to the regional director of ICE to request access, which did not result in any changes. We decided to move forward with legal action,"" said Victoria Bejarano Muirhead, a legal expert at the Innovation Law Lab, which is assisting the majority of the asylum-seekers with their immigration cases.Muirhead said the men are now going through their credible fear interviews, one of the first steps toward being granted asylum in the US. At least 50 of the men in detention have passed that test so far.Thursday's filing alleges that the Bureau of Prisons and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement are violating the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Bureau of Prisons' own guidelines on religious freedom.Religious leaders also say they had been trying to reach men at the prison for weeks but were turned away by prison staff several times.Rev. Ron Werner Jr., an organizer at the Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice, said he was allowed into the prison for the first time on Wednesday to lead a Christian service, but was not permitted to minister to individual detainees. He said Sikh leaders were granted entry once last week.""I just jumped through every hoop they gave me for the last six weeks,"" he said, adding that he's been able to access ICE detainees held at a local county jail far more easily than those at the federal prison.""It kind of speaks to why this facility is not equipped to handle individuals who are detained through ICE,"" he continued.Last week, Hay filed 74 petitions on behalf of the asylum-seekers, citing overcrowded cells, a lack of adequate medical care, and meals that violated religious restrictions. The petitions asked for immediate relief from those conditions and for the asylum-seekers to have their cases heard by a judge.The pubic defender's office collected testimonies after they gained access to the detainees last month. The asylum-seekers said they were held in cells for up to 22 hours per day, expected to eat in their cells next to open toilets, strip-searched in front of other detainees, and not given changes of clothes for several days on end.“Here we have come to save our lives but I think we will die here in jail,” one asylum-seeker said, according to Teesdale's affidavit in that filing.""Criminals live along with us,"" said another man. ""We were very afraid of them. I had wrapped towel on my head but it was taken off from my head. It is violation against our religion.""Teesdale said in Thursday's filing that while ""many of the conditions have improved since the end of June"" when they were moved out of the general population and into a separate block of the prison, ""detainees continue to report significant limitations on their ability to practice their faith."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/26/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-13817-1532650304-13.jpg?crop=1596:835;0,114dd23e8e2376243a89b562ae3a020f06e	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		This Immigrant Returned To Her Dangerous Home Country — Where She’d Been Raped — After Having A Miscarriage In A US Detention Center	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	This Immigrant Returned To Her Dangerous Home Country — Where She’d Been Raped — After Having A Miscarriage In A US Detention Center	0	"E. returned to El Salvador to be with her two children. Then the US made it much harder for her to try to return and flee the gangs targeting her.John Moore / Getty Images A pregnant immigrant from El Salvador — who is not E. — next to a Border Patrol truck after turning herself in Dec. 7, 2015.Two months after having a miscarriage inside an immigrant detention center in the US, E. voluntarily returned to El Salvador, the country she tried to flee for fear of the gang members who raped her two years ago and continue to threaten her to this day. “I don’t feel safe. I don’t sleep; I don’t have an appetite. I am always on edge that something is going to happen to me or my kids,” she told BuzzFeed News over the phone, in Spanish. “I feel even more in danger than before. … I don’t want to lose the two children I have left.” She’s staying with her mother and still trying to process and mourn her miscarriage. BuzzFeed News is not disclosing E.’s full name or the names of other people and specific locations because she is currently in danger from gang members and authorities in El Salvador. And Amnesty International says women are often convicted of aggravated homicide after suffering miscarriages. “It’s a crime to be a woman in this country,” she told BuzzFeed News. Her plan was to return home, recover from her miscarriage while not in a detention center, gather up her two children, who are both under 12 years old, and try to make the grueling trip to the US again. But a recent decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions may throw all that into chaos. One evening in December 2016, E. was walking home after meeting a friend when several men followed her down the street and forced her at gunpoint to go to an abandoned house with them. One of them, a Barrio 18 gang member, raped her while others stood guard outside. “He told me that if I did not open my legs that he was going to stick a knife between my legs. He told me that since I was a single woman and that he was a gang member that he had the right to do this to a woman,” she told US immigration officials in her credible fear test, which is an initial interview to determine whether someone is at risk if they’re returned to their home country. “He told me that women like me do not have the right to anything but sex, sex, sex, and that we do not have the right for anything else,” she said in the interview, an official transcript of which was reviewed by BuzzFeed News. After four or five hours, the gang members took her home. The man who raped her told her not to leave the house and that he would have gang members watching her. “I do not know how he got my telephone number,” she said in the interview, “but he would call me and tell me that he was going to kill me.”John Moore / Getty Images An immigrant — who is not E. — from Mexico waits to be deported from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement center April 28, 2010, in Phoenix.E. filed a report with local police anyway, who she said gave her a reference number to use instead of her name as a safety measure. But the day after she filed the report, she said in the interview, she got a call from the gang member who raped her. He said he knew she’d gone to the police, and that police worked for the gang. E. also detailed in her interview with the government years of physical abuse by a man starting when she was 11 years old. She had reported him to police multiple times, but each time he was taken into custody, he was released in about a week. After nearly a year and a half of continued threats from the gang, E. left El Salvador in March to seek refuge in the US. While she was making the journey, an MS-13 gang member threatened in a social media post to kill her. She was around four months pregnant when she arrived at the border and told border patrol agents that she was seeking asylum. While she was in detention in San Luis, Arizona, she began bleeding profusely — and though she asked repeatedly for help, she said officials ignored her requests, and she had a miscarriage. Ultimately, days after she spoke to BuzzFeed News about her miscarriage and the medical neglect she and other women alleged they suffered at the hands of US Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, E. asked for voluntary departure to return to El Salvador. She returned in early July. “I couldn’t take it anymore. I just felt that I couldn’t go on there. All I wanted was my son in my arms and they wouldn’t help me,” she said, referring to the baby she lost in her miscarriage. “They don’t have hearts; they wouldn’t help me,” she told BuzzFeed News. Another reason she returned, she said, was that it wasn’t clear to her how long it would take to bring her other two children over to join her in the US even if she were granted asylum. ICE and CBP responded to BuzzFeed News’ original article on E.’s treatment by referring to their written guidelines on detaining pregnant women. E. is looking for a way to leave El Salvador again soon, and this time would take her son and daughter with her immediately. “I just don’t want to lose my two children that I have left,” E. said. She has carefully carried all her records back with her from the US, including documentation of her credible fear interview. She passed her credible fear interview, meaning US Customs and Immigration Services officials agreed that she demonstrated enough concern about being in danger in El Salvador that her case for asylum should be heard in full by an immigration judge. But there’s a new obstacle in her way: a Department of Justice ruling from June in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that gang violence and domestic violence are no longer generally considered legitimate grounds for asylum by the US government. They count as “private violence,” Sessions argued, as opposed to “group persecution that the government is unable or unwilling to address.” “The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes — such as domestic violence or gang violence — or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim,” Sessions wrote. The Department of Justice referred BuzzFeed News to a statement from June, which reiterated that “victims of personal crimes” do not fit the definition of “individuals who have been persecuted, or who have a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of their membership in a ‘particular social group.’” Sessions wrote in his ruling that asylum-seekers must prove that they are being persecuted because they are members of a well-defined social group that’s being specifically targeted. He added that victims of gang violence and domestic violence would probably not be able to prove that under this ruling. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment beyond their statement from last month. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.Elliot Spagat / AP A 2017 file photo of the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego, where at one point E. was detained.Alex Mensing, a project coordinator with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, has been in touch with E. since she joined one of the group’s migrant caravans in Mexico on the way to the US in March. “This is the kind of thing that would apply to somebody like E.: You have a situation where the US government doesn’t want to recognize that gangs have essentially turned into the State, and being persecuted by a gang is like being persecuted by the government,” he said. Sessions’ decision may already be leading to more negative outcomes for women who apply for asylum after experiencing domestic or gang violence, according to Irena Sullivan, senior immigration policy counsel at the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that advocates for women and girls fleeing gender-based violence. “The ruling is very harmful for women targeted by gangs, even if they tried to reach out to police and were ignored,” she said. “The burden for women is much, much higher now to show that the government actually condoned the violence and wasn’t merely ineffective in protecting them. This ignores the reality of survivors’ experiences on the ground, and the extreme nature of the threats they face.” Sullivan said the rules may allow US Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers to more easily deny them during their credible fear interviews — before they’re even given the chance to go before an immigration judge who can make a more nuanced assessment of their cases. Soon after Sessions’ ruling last month, President Trump tweeted, “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.”We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents...Human rights groups say gangs like Barrio 18 and MS-13 are known to target women and have a “very big arm” throughout Central America and the US.“They are in collusion with law enforcement,” said Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, advocacy director at Amnesty International USA. “Our concerns in terms of asylum-seekers is that the [Salvadoran] justice system can’t protect these individuals from being targeted by Barrio 18 or MS-13.” Amnesty International calls El Salvador “one of the most dangerous countries to be a woman” in their most recent report on the country. The report adds that, as a result of gang violence and a lack of government stability, it also has one of the world’s highest murder rates — 3,605 Salvadorans were murdered in 2017, including 429 femicides. And 900 women were reported raped in 2017, among nearly 3,000 total reported sexual assaults, according to El Salvador’s Legal Institute of Medicine. In the first four months of 2018, 155 femicides had been committed in the country, an increase of more than 20% from the same period last year. The two dominant gangs in the country, Barrio 18 and MS-13, were both founded in the US and brought back to El Salvador mostly in the 1990s, according to InSight Crime, an organization that tracks organized crime in Latin America. Excluding gang violence and domestic violence from asylum claims is in contrast to decades of US legal case law and contravenes international human rights laws, said Katie Shepherd, national advocacy counsel at the American Immigration Council. She said the decision is “yet another attack in the administration’s war on bona fide asylum-seekers.” Refugee resettlement agencies say they’re especially troubled by Department of Homeland Security guidance issued July 11 instructing border patrol and asylum agents on how to carry out Sessions’ decision. The guidance presents five bullet points of what officers should consider when they’re deciding whether or not to approve an asylum case, including whether the person can prove their government cannot or will not protect them, whether they could live elsewhere in their own country instead of seeking asylum, and finally leaves it up to “the officer’s discretion.” “There’s so many things wrong with this guidance,” said Mark Hetfield, CEO of HIAS, a resettlement agency that works with dozens of women from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala fleeing gang and domestic violence. “It’s going to be very difficult if this guidance is implemented successfully. It’s so outrageous that this would be done without any notice or comment period, rolling back decades of asylum law.” For E., being back where her rape happened and knowing that the police can’t protect her is frightening. She barely leaves the house. She’s planning to go to the US Embassy to ask what else she can do to get herself and her children to a safe place. “I was happy when she came back, but on the other hand I was scared for her after everything that happened to her,” her mother, who also did not want to use her name for fear of retribution, told BuzzFeed News. “It’s bad here for women. It’s bad. Just recently three girls disappeared and then one was found mutilated,” her mother said. “I told [E.], ‘It’s better if you go somewhere else.’” In her interview with the government, E. was asked about her rape, “Why do you believe this person targeted you specifically?” “I don’t know. I asked him why he would do this and that I had never talked to them and that I did not have anything against them,” she said. “He said that they have the right to do this to the women and that is the reason why there are so many women dead.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/20/9/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/89e5ab60b0b0e5740ca3b966b8481e44-0.jpg?crop=622:325;0,9009d51e098ba84f1981efb0d239437032	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		"A Senator Said He Thinks ""Something Close To"" The Trump Pee Tape Exists"	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	"A Senator Said He Thinks ""Something Close To"" The Trump Pee Tape Exists"	0	"Sen.

The report also cuts against President Donald Trump's glowing comments about how his administration handled the recovery — at one point he downplayed the severity of the storm's aftermath.Advocacy group Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit last week for the report after the agency did not respond to their May FOIA request for its findings, and the document was released late Thursday night.The study found severe personnel shortages, difficulties coordinating relief logistics, a lack of basic aid supplies, and a lack of local preparation, among other shortcomings.Notably, for the first 72 hours after the storm hit Puerto Rico, FEMA “had little information about the status of infrastructure, including hospitals, roads and water facilities,” according to the agency.“Because FEMA and its partners lacked situational awareness early in the response, the Agency initially could not be certain that FEMA and interagency partner efforts were sufficient to stabilize the incident,” it found.For one week after the hurricane, FEMA did not have information about the status of 24 out of 52 wastewater treatment plants or 37 of 69 hospitals.This was the same week in which there was a spike in the number of deaths per day, as BuzzFeed News has reported. Several people also died of leptospirosis, a waterborne disease, in the days following the hurricane, reports have found.Despite efforts to provide relief and supplies to impacted areas in a timely way, the agency rapidly found itself overwhelmed by the storms, its internal assessment shows.“In response to Hurricane Irma impacts, FEMA distributed more than 80 percent of its inventory for selected commodities from the Caribbean Distribution Center warehouse,” it states. “Hurricane Maria struck before supplies were replenished.”It also took several days for food and fresh water to reach the island, and distribution, once the supplies arrived, was challenging with a lack of diesel, functional roads, and available drivers.In response to the agency's findings, FEMA recommended that the local Puerto Rico government and authorities build “a culture of preparedness” by investing in more supplies and “more resilient infrastructure,"" such as electrical grids.The internal assessment of FEMA’s response to the storms stands in high contrast to President Trump’s most recent comments on relief efforts, in which he praised his administration, saying it “leapt into action to coordinate the response.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/18/7/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/fema-admits-its-response-to-hurricane-maria-in-pu-2-2604-1531914646-0_dblbig.jpgde42d24baca843ae8af79ad8d10eb3d4	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		"""It's All Gone To Hell"": Puerto Rico's Power Authority Just Lost Two CEOs In One Week"	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	"""It's All Gone To Hell"": Puerto Rico's Power Authority Just Lost Two CEOs In One Week"	0	"Four of the other six PREPA board members resigned with him, writing in a letter to the governor that they saw Rosselló's actions as interfering with efforts to depoliticize the agency after years of nepotism, especially as its operations come under scrutiny from Congress in the wake of the controversial Whitefish Energy contract.Rafael Diaz-Granados, who was appointed CEO on Wednesday by the PREPA board, resigned Thursday morning after public outcry about his $750,000 salary led Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to ask the board to reduce his pay. Diaz-Granados, who has been a board member since last year, was due to take up his post on Sunday.PREPA did not immediately respond to questions asking if day-to-day operations on power lines are continuing uninterrupted, and how plans to rebuild and strengthen the electric grid will be affected.""In the last 48 hours, it's all gone to hell because nobody knows anything, period. Not even the [higher-up] directors of the company know,"" he said. ""Nobody knows what's going on. Everybody here in the company found out through the press.""Staff at the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have been left without a clear idea of who will be in charge or how to move forward with hurricane recuperation efforts and preparations for the current hurricane season, an employee who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation told BuzzFeed News.Puerto Rico's electric power authority is effectively without a leader after the second CEO in less than a week resigned Thursday morning along with most of the board members.""The political forces in Puerto Rico have provided a definitive statement that they want to continue to control PREPA,"" the letter said. ""When the petty political interests of politicians are put ahead of the needs of the people, the process of transforming the Puerto Rican electricity sector is put at risk.""The board members who resigned were appointed independently through a headhunting firm, leaving just the two members appointed directly by Rosselló.""When [Diaz-Granados'] salary went public everybody went nuts over here saying, 'How can it be you have a company that is bankrupt, cutting salaries of employees … you are taking away incentives and fringe benefits and yet you find the money to hire someone for three-quarters of a million dollars?'"" said the PREPA employee.But, he added, there is also a sense inside the company that qualified candidates who would do the job for less money are too politically connected to the government.""The thing is those qualified people who could do the work for less money have some sort of personal ties to the government. That’s the problem right now,"" he said.As the agency's internal turmoil continues, the power grid remains vulnerable — public officials say that even a storm much milder than Hurricane Maria could knock out the power grid again.Up to 5,499 people on the island are still living without electricity after losing it during the hurricanes last September. Rosselló has acknowledged that as the island braces for another hurricane season, the grid is in worse shape than it was before Hurricane Maria.And the upheaval at PREPA comes in the context of Rosselló's decision earlier this year to privatize the public utility, with the agency around $9 billion in debt. Rosselló's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Walter Higgins, who was appointed PREPA CEO in March, resigned earlier this week for personal reasons. During his tenure, the agency had developed a plan to complete grid repairs, according to the PREPA employee who spoke to BuzzFeed News.""There’s no clear direction of which way we’re going,"" he said. ""We sort of had a plan with Mr. Higgins, we sort of had something laid out for us but right now we don't know what's coming, we don't know what the plan is, we don't know jack.""At a congressional hearing in May, then-CEO Higgins was asked about the agency's internal workings and whether he thought there was a corruption problem among its higher ranks.""I don’t know enough about it yet to know that,"" he said, adding, ""I can tell you this much with respect to PREPA. There are always going to be in an organization of 6,000 people something going on that shouldn’t be, and we are going to vigorously go after and investigate anything that’s not done the right way."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/12/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/its-all-gone-to-hell-puerto-ricos-power-authority-2-18044-1531435989-0_dblbig.jpgac036544ec014e1b9aa207b5a0d2d57b	['Buzzfeed Staff']		Build A Grilled Cheese And We'll Tell You Something You Need To Do Right Now	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Build A Grilled Cheese And We'll Tell You Something You Need To Do Right Now	0	"Get all the best Tasty recipes in your inbox!

Here are a few of the absolute wildest:1. This touchy-toucher. ashleyzuefleb / Via buzzfeed.com I have this Harry Potter piece on my forearm and I was showing a new client to our conference room at work when she asked to see my tattoo. I held out my arm and she LATCHED on. She loved it because her daughter also liked Harry Potter, but it was weird trying to yank my arm back from a strange woman I’ve never met before. Please people, no touchy! —ashleyzuefleb2. This Pinterest photographer. A random stranger at Walmart wanted to take a photo of my collarbone tattoo to put on his Pinterest. —aprilm4ecddbafd3.

One time, after explaining to a stranger that the tattoo was my version of a memorial, they responded: ""You know he's dead, he can't see it."" Yes, thank you for that. —bamms5964. This creepy proposition. We were at Wendy's and a man behind us in line was was admiring my husband's full sleeves.

Still weird, buddy. —themeggersuit5. This sexist fan. I have a tattoo on my back that encapsulates my six favorite pieces of pop culture into one big piece (Harry Potter, Star Wars, Avengers, Doctor Who, Supernatural, and Lord of the Rings). Shortly after getting it, I was told that this tattoo was ""wasted on a woman,"" by a man wearing a t-shirt for one of the six fandoms. —keelhaulrose26.

I'm 31. —savannahg4ed2462597. This not-so-fatherly advice. I was minding my own business on the street and some man came up to me and said, “If you were my daughter I would NEVER let you have tattoos.” I told him I’m glad that I’m not his daughter. —aylab4208. This wedding vow. When I started getting my tattoos at 22, people would always ask me, “What about when you get married? You won’t want to show those tattoos with your dress!” Jokes on them, cause I’m getting married this September (at age 36, so that just goes to show you how long I’ve been dealing with this stupid question) and I purposely bought a sleeveless dress that shows off all of my ink. —aronc45845a10e9. This savage Grandma. My grandma once said to my dad, who is a tattoo artist, ""The only good tattoo you have is the one of your daughter's name."" My dad's got sleeves on both arms. I just sat there like goddamn, sis, calm down. —rfriri12310. This temporary(?) tattoo. My sister's mother-in-law saw her tattoo for the first time and said, “Is this really what you want?” My sister sarcastically responded, “You know what? No. Let me just go WASH IT OFF.” —d4bc79428e11. This back-handed compliment. calikelsi / Via buzzfeed.com While out at a bar with friends some random, incredibly drunk guy came up to me and said, “You know, I usually find tattoos on women really unattractive, but they don’t look so bad on you!” I think it was meant to be a compliment??? —calikelsi12. This awful fellow actor. I’m a theater major, and I hope to be a professional actor someday. I have a small star tattooed on my finger. After I got it, a friend of mine (who is also a theater major) told me that I was ""very brave"" for getting a tattoo because, according to them, “Directors won’t want to work with someone with tattoos.” Apparently no one has told them about the magical qualities of makeup. —missjoeydiva13. This meaning maniac. A guy I used to work with aggressively demanded I tell him what ALL of my tattoos mean because “You put it on your body so you have to tell people what they mean!"" —mkfg1914. This flexible(?) artist. I'm a tattoo artist and have a small hummingbird on the right side of my upper back. Someone once asked if I'd done that tattoo myself. I'm not quite that limber. —desireev4cf2f141315. This pretzel problem. cargoss16 / Via buzzfeed.com I have 3 Celtic heart knots on my left forearm and I have had multiple people ask me, “Are those pretzels on your arm? Is that because it’s your favorite snack?” —cargoss1616. This perfect crime. My mother informed me that, since I have a tattoo, I now have a ""distinguishing mark,"" and if someone that looks like me with a similar tattoo commits a crime, I could be blamed because ""Only hooligans get tattoos."" —a4659365c617. This ""witch."" I have a tattoo of a crow skull on my wrist. A few years back when I was waitressing, a well-dressed older couple kept violently flinching EVERY TIME I walked near there table. Finally, after several rounds of this, the woman grabbed my wrist while I was passing and whispered, ""Are...are you a witch?"" —lyndsayr42c1074c718. This super-duper creep. I was shopping for boots in a department store, and a male associate came up to me, looked me up and down, and said, ""Look at all those tattoos. You must really like pain, huh?"" Not creepy at all. —shayface19. This worried mother. I was having dinner at a nice restaurant with my boyfriend when a woman came to our table and asked me to ""please cover my tattoos"" because they were ""scaring"" her baby. My tattoos are all of flowers??? —abear331220. This tasty tattoo. fluffernutterkitty I have a piece with fruits and veggies on my upper arm. The artist did a great job and yes, they look realistic...but comments like ""I bet your arm tastes delicious"" are just creepy. ESPECIALLY FROM STRANGERS! —fluffernutterkitty21. This music rule. I have music notes on my wrist because I, you know, love music. I've had more than one person tell me I can't have music notes unless I'm a musician. One of the people who've told me this had feather tattoo, so I guess he could fly??? —nataliep4437f99fa22. This serial killer-y comment. Someone once told me “Your skin is probably worth thousands.” This is, easily, the most serial killer-y thing I've ever been told, but sure, okay. —autumnh4b41c812023. This confused relative. I have a large tattoo my my right calf and I had a relative ask me how I shave my legs with a tattoo. I was like...with a razor like normal? The tattoo is underneath the skin, not sitting on top of it. It amazes me that people don't understand how tattoos work. —ingajorgensenm24. This Batman bandaid. I have two full sleeves, a couple of back tattoos, and a scattering of tattoos on my legs. A guy once walked by me and said, “Oh, I really like that tattoo!” I said thanks and asked which one...he was referring to my Batman bandaid. He thought a bandaid was one of my tattoos. TBH, I’ve strongly considered getting a tattoo of a Batman bandaid since then. —akolar25. And, finally, this MLP gang. pinkdeedle / Via buzzfeed.com “Are you in a gang?” Yes, of course, everyone is familiar with the super-terrifying My Little Pony gang. —pinkdeedle"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/23/16/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/original-17952-1535055461-2.jpg?crop=1500:785;0,214a275ec72d4a941948abb33658f16957c	[]		$1

Simply start heating your eggs in a cold pot or pan with a few pats of butter, and slowly start cooking them — stirring often. As the pan gets hot, take it off the heat and continue stirring them. Place it back on the heat, and repeat this motion so the pot never heats up too hot.

I made a spreadsheet of all the duties and projects I was already doing, as well as things I'd done that had been the manager's responsibility prior to his departure, and presented it to my department head. The company culture was no degree = no management position, but I told him I would not train someone else to be my 'boss,' and then have to do all the work myself. I could be the replacement, and if the company was smart, they'd want to keep me.

And I love 'em anyways! But on the days I'm mentally prepared to spend an extra 30 seconds rubbing in cleansing oil at the end of the day (I'm dramatic, yes), I like to give them a lil' boost from a mascara wand. However, not all mascaras are created equal. Some mascaras are messy and end up getting all over my lids during application and undereye area after a few short hours, and don't end up giving me the volume I need, because they simply can't grasp onto my little lashes. Well, folks, Winky Lux So Extra Mascara doesn't do any of that. One coat of this, and even my poor eyesight can tell a major difference — two, and my lashes are super thicc and ready to party! I like the straight wand because I find those tend to grasp onto my lashes better than hourglass applicators — for example, a super thin wand I like to use is the Innisfree Skinny Microcara — and gives me a more even coating all throughout. Honestly, I think the photos speak for themselves. So fresh, so light, and so drama-inducing (well, as much as my lashes allow). —Sarah Han, As/Is and Shopping & Products WriterNot to brag, but I am what some would call a mascara connoisseur. I don’t REALLY use eyeliner, so I pretty much rely on the magic of mascara to make me seem more awake — which, let me tell you, is no easy feat. And this Winky Lux So Extra Mascara? It’s truly fantastic. This mascara provides a crazy amount of length without looking clumpy and gunky in the process. I don’t get panda eyes throughout the day (meaning that black doesn’t bleed from my lower lashline, LOL) and the formula itself is super buildable. I can add more of a dramatic ~oomph~ by adding an extra swipe or two and it still remains clump-free. But the truly “WOW THIS IS AMAZING!” aspect of it all? It lasts. It really, truly lasts. It’s still there at the end of the day and it looks as if I’ve just put it on. I don’t need to reapply for after-work happy hours because I really don’t need to! That is true joy. Plus, the packaging is pretty darn adorable. —AnaMaria Glavan, Shopping & Products WriterGet it from Winky Lux for $16."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/14/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/original-23240-1537899709-4.jpg?crop=1198:627;0,08c5fa06790194f93acb913c0ab2c4dad	['Buzzfeed Staff']		Close-Up: Kelly Rowland Doesn't Care What You Think Anymore	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Close-Up: Kelly Rowland Doesn't Care What You Think Anymore	0	"Damian Bennett / Ellie Sunakawa / BuzzFeedIt wasn't until high school and college when people would say, ""You're so pretty for a dark-skinned girl,"" that I really became aware of colorism. I couldn't quite process the meaning of the backhanded compliment, but it made me feel weird and my response was always a hesitant and confused ""Thank you?"" Through talking with peers about their own experiences being discriminated against because they were darker-skinned and as I noted the dwindling absence of chocolate girls in mainstream media — particularly as the love interests in BET music videos — I began to understand what that ""compliment"" meant. As Destiny's Child split and each member pursued their solo careers, I thought, This is it! Kelly's the one to put dark-skinned black women back into the narrative! I knew that if anyone could shake things up, it was her. She could sing and dance, she was charismatic on late night TV, and she was undeniably, EXCEPTIONALLY stunning. She's a real star by America's standards. I went into full stage mom mode, planning what I wanted for her career. She could become the face of a major cosmetics brand, co-host a panel talk show, reinvent herself as an EDM artist to draw a clear separation from her girl group bandmates (the Grammy-winning record ""When Love Takes Over"" with David Guetta was proof that this was a lane she could own). I wanted to see her in Covergirl commercials and Balmain campaigns because that's the kind of visibility, as shallow as it is, that shifts mainstream beauty standards. And this was not to minimize all that Kelly had given us: ""Dilemma,"" X-Factor (U.K, USA), The Voice (Australia), ""Motivation"" and its steamy BET Awards performance, four solid R&B albums that were actual bodies of work and not just singles, and the rare star power to hold our attention for 20-plus years in a constantly evolving entertainment industry. But I still wanted more. I wanted her celebrity to single-handedly fix a centuries-old, deep-rooted societal ill that she had no hand in creating — and having that desire was both unrealistic and unfair. I didn't come to the latter realization until a few months ago at a Schick launch event, where I talked to Kelly Rowland who is a face of the brand's Intuition F.A.B. Razor Kit (it literally shaves in BOTH directions so you can't cut yourself). We obviously talked about products because I'm always gonna get the beau-tea when given the chance to chat with one of the most gorgeous celebrities of our time, but I also asked her all the questions the Kelly stan in me wanted to know, like why she's yet to follow my dreams for her and endorse a major makeup or skin care brand. By the end of the conversation I sensed that she was genuinely happy with how she'd evolved — professionally, but more importantly personally — and my own idea of what her evolution should look like paled in comparison to her's.In a ""Breakfast Club"" interview, Jermaine Dupri said it's still hard for dark-skinned women in the industry. We can point to examples of that representation, like yourself, but there's still a disparity. What are your thoughts on that?I think that things will continue to get better. Whitney Houston did it: a chocolate girl. Jody Watley did it: chocolate girl. I did it, and I'm still not done. Now it's just time to get back on it, you know what I mean? I think that you continue to open up doors for artists who really connect with women. As a black woman we can sense when you're for us. It's time for that artist. I don't know if she even sings, but I am such a fan of Marsai Martin from Black-ish. I literally love her! I love the fact that she's just so unapologetic and chocolate, so proud and confident in herself. I put that one on my shoulder. I hold her up high and want other people to celebrate her. Of course there's other ladies out there and we celebrate them, too, but she's another generation and she's one that I see.[Watch the ""Breakfast Club"" interview here. Colorism commentary at 39:40.]I love that you stan for her. Have you met her?I met her, but then I hit her on IG — oh yes, honey, I follow Marsai — and just told her how I think she's just incredible. I used ""intelligent"" first, because I think that's what we have to instill in our younger generation. Your intelligence, your knowledge. Your beauty is one thing, but I just feel like she's such a great representation of a generation.Schick Kelly Rowland and Sr. Beauty Editor for BuzzFeed As/Is, Essence Gant.You've haven't intentionally made giving a voice to people who've been left out of the mainstream beauty narrative your mission, but you've done that just by your sheer existence and we love you for it, black women especially.I love you back.I often wonder if people with an exceptional quality know that they have it. Like, did Whitney actually know she had the greatest voice of all time? And I always wonder if you know you're exceptionally stunning. Do you ever think about it?I don't know if I necessarily think about it like that. When my makeup is done right, when my hair is flawless [I feel fly]. Or when I don't have anything on at all, that's actually when I feel fly. When my husband says the right thing to me I feel fly. The first time my son held my face in his hands and he said, ""I love you, Mommy,"" that made me feel stunning! The day that I had him, I felt like I could do anything. Maybe it's because the older I get, the more I appreciate those things because to be honest, I didn't really get my worth — not even just about beauty — but just worth. It started to click in at like twenty-seven. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, I was like, ""Oh, you dope!"" I remember there was a time in my life where I operated off of,""What does that person think? Should I do what they say?"" I don't give a fuck anymore. I really, really don't. It's just all about what makes me happy, [and] my family makes me happy.It made so much sense when Schick announced this partnership because you're a beauty icon and should be aligning with women's lifestyle brands. Would you ever be the face of a major cosmetics company?I'd love my own! That's what [my makeup artist] Sheika Daley and I are working on now, but that's another side conversation. It takes a lot of money for that. It's on both of our vision boards. We've already actually started the beginnings of making the product. We have all the samples. It's just that next phase is really expensive.Your skin is incredible! Give me a rundown of your skin care routine.What are your top five favorite products you can't live without?So who's the what of Destiny's Child because in every sisterhood, every friendship, there's a dynamic?Ooh, gosh, that's a hard question. Michelle is the soul, Bey is the brain, I'm the heart. Bey is the brain 'cause the way we figure stuff out in the studio, it's pretty remarkable. She's like, ""Oh, let's do this,"" and then we bounce off of that. It's even awesome in the fact that we're able to do that amongst each other and be so secure within what we bring to the table. I think that's how groups really last. You have to be secure in what you bring to the table, and know that one light is not higher or lower or whatever. They're all dynamic, and they all need each other. I secretly call us another trinity.How happy were you when Michelle got engaged?WHAT?! Oh my god! When she called me, I started crying. I was in Australia and I was in such shock. But, by the way, if you ask her, I told her she was going to be engaged in a year. I literally told her. When I met him, I knew that me and Chad were gonna be close, and we are. I knew that he was gonna be a good guy, and he is such a good guy and she deserves a good guy. He's just awesome, and she's amazing, so I'm just happy that they found each other and happy that they trusted God, they trusted love. And look where they are!What do you want your legacy to be? Obviously you're in the best girl group of all time and you've done such amazing work. But Kelly Rowland, the individual person, what do you want that legacy to be?That I was a light. I feel like it's so much happening in the world already... People are already walking around in enough darkness. When God gives you a platform — I'm gonna start crying — you're supposed to be a light. I know it's so much different energy I'm about to take on [onstage], so let me pour my light into you. That's what you deserve. You paid your ticket to come. This obviously means you want to be fulfilled, you want to be happy, you want a memory. I have to give you light. I have to give you light for my record. I have to give you light when I speak to you. I have to pour into you, the way I feel God pours into me every day. I'm so blessed in the way my husband pours into me, or the way my baby pours into me, the way my assistant pours into me, the way my team pours into me, the way you're pouring into me right now. I just wanna be a light.Kelly Rowland-approved products:"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/24/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-22438-1537826985-2.png?crop=800:418;177,116c790af2341574b18a1eb30417a7c83d4	['Buzzfeed Staff']		We Try YesStyle Clothes For Under $100	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	We Try YesStyle Clothes For Under $100	0	"Get our newsletter twice a week for more tips, tricks, and trends.Sign up"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/27/10/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/we-try-yesstyle-clothes-for-under-100-2-25308-1535378484-0_dblbig.jpg0055756e7fc34f4790a543a411bdcb0a	['Buzzfeed Contributor']		Banning The Binary Makes Dating Better For Everyone	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Banning The Binary Makes Dating Better For Everyone	0	"One of the most exhausting things about being a gender nonconforming person in a two-gender world is the all-pervasive perception that I’m just being annoying; the feeling that, by asking a binary world to respect me as I am, I am asking too much; the idea that people like me are being extra. View this photo on Instagram Instagram: @jacobtobia The specter of “being too much” follows me around most everywhere that I go. When I ask if there are gender neutral bathrooms at a restaurant? Too much. When I ask if there are gender options other than “man” and “woman” on paperwork? Too much. When I want to go through security at the airport without being addressed as “sir”? Too much. When I ask parents to teach their children to affirm gender nonconforming people? Too much. It feels like I’m always asking the world for too much. In a culture that was built to exclude us, gender nonconforming and non-binary trans folks like me are made to seem demanding anytime we ask to be treated with dignity and according to the way that we identify.Never am I made to feel more demanding or needy or extra than when I dare to correct people who use the wrong pronouns. I use the gender neutral pronouns “they/them” because “he/him” just doesn’t feel right. According to many, this makes me a difficult person. When someone refers to me as “he” and I let that person know that I actually prefer the gender neutral pronoun “they,” it almost always makes things awkward. No matter how chill I am when I correct people, they’re always worried that they’ve hurt me deeply by using the wrong pronoun. I’m rarely hurt when someone uses the wrong pronoun; most of the time it’s just an honest mistake. But I am hurt when, after I’ve corrected someone, they choose to become defensive or awkward about the whole thing.So yeah, correcting someone who misgenders me is often uncomfortable. But correcting someone attractive and charming and interesting and cute who misgenders me on a first date can be almost unbearable. Think about it. You meet someone new at a cute bar or restaurant. You didn’t think it was possible, but he’s somehow even sexier in person than he appeared online. The attraction is instant. The conversation is flowing. Then, out of the blue, he references you in third person for the first time to the waiter. It’s innocent, but glaring. Despite the fact that you’re wearing a cute dress and lipstick, it just comes out. “He’ll have the martini,” or “He’s going to have the pasta.”Oh gosh.It’s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t type of situation. In the moment, the fact that he said “he” instead of “they” feels like such a little thing. But it also feels like such a huge thing. I mean, do you really need to correct him? If you correct him now, will it derail the conversation and make you seem needy? Maybe. Will it prompt a conversation about your gender identity that you might not be ready to have on the first date? Definitely. So you entertain the possibility of waiting to correct him later. View this photo on Instagram Instagram: @jacobtobia But if you correct him later, it might be even worse. He might read something into the fact that you waited to correct him. It might violate his sense of trust. He might feel like you were being dishonest or holding something back. It could make things even weirder if you wait.So, even though you don’t really want to, you correct him then and there. You tell him that you use gender-neutral pronouns. And though he swears he’s chill about it, it still makes things weird. The air gets sucked out of the room. Any momentum that you may have had halts in its tracks. You get through the rest of the date alright, but when you say goodbye, you can already tell that he’s gonna ghost, that you’re “too complicated” and this thing that could have maybe gone somewhere is now going nowhere all because of a stupid pronoun mix-up. Ever since I began identifying as non-binary, this scenario has played out over and over again during the course of my dating life. And oh boy am I ever sick of it.It’s even more revolutionary than it sounds. Beyond the obvious – that this will help people like me avoid getting misgendered on first dates – this small change does something more. It upends the tired notion that gender nonconforming people like me are being “too demanding” by asking the world to accommodate our identities. OkCupid is sending the important message that people like me are valid; that asking romantic partners to respect pronouns from the first date is not an egregious expectation. Non-binary people like me are no longer asking too much. We are simply asking for what all people deserve: a respectful dating culture free from gender stereotypes.By placing pronoun preference front and center, by making it just another piece of useful information, OkCupid is proactively creating a more inclusive dating culture for everyone. This change matters for cisgender and heterosexual people just as much as it matters for trans and non-binary folks like me. OkCupid Including pronouns is yet another way that all users, regardless of how they identify along the platform’s 22 gender and 13 sexual orientation options, are encouraged to practice empathy and kindness while swimming in the dating pool.It’s a needed fix, because the gender binary has really messed up dating culture. Since I was a kid, I've been inundated with talk about ""what girls want,"" and ""what guys like,"" but those conversations always center around the idea that guys want the same thing, that women are, more or less, similar. I know that in our hyper-informed digital world this probably isn't an earth-shattering idea, but it bears repeating: all guys are not the same. All girls are not the same. No matter how similar they may appear, no two guys or two girls want the same thing out of a first date or out of a relationship. The gender binary, the idea that people are sortable into one of two gender categories, is flawed to begin with.The lie that the gender binary tells you is this: if you know someone’s gender, you can then safely assume a lot of other things about them. If you know that someone is male, the gender binary would tell you that you can assume what *his* goals are in life, what *he* enjoys doing in bed, what clothes *he* enjoys wearing, what size spoon *he’d* like to be, and what pronouns *he* prefers. If you know that someone is female, the gender binary suggests that you also know how *she* would like to be treated, whether or not *she’ll* pay for dinner, what sorts of gifts *she’d* like on your anniversary, how *she* prefers to dress, and what pronouns *she* uses. The moment we know someone’s gender, we assume so much else about them. And that’s fucked.Operating your dating life on the basis of the gender binary takes all of the fun out of romance: all of the whimsy and experimentation and air out of the thing. When we operate within the set of assumptions that we were given by the world about how gender should work – including, but certainly not limited to, what pronouns we use to talk about our partners -- we lose out not only on the opportunity for fantastic, sexy, thrilling dates, but also on the chance to create a more empathetic, enjoyable dating culture for everyone. View this photo on Instagram Instagram: @jacobtobia The gender binary is responsible for the rampant transphobia and sexism that still exist in our modern world, sure, but it is also responsible for something that is less often discussed: a plague of bad dates and mediocre sex.Here’s the truth: knowing someone’s gender or sex tells you hardly anything about who they are. Knowing that someone identifies as a woman or man or genderqueer or trans gives you very little useful information to go off of. Knowing whether someone was assigned male or female at birth tells you basically nothing about what they’re passionate about. Want to know what music someone’s into? You have to ask. Want to know whether someone prefers being big spoon or little spoon? You have to ask. Want to know whether someone enjoys sports? You have to ask. Want to know how someone feels about paying for dinner or opening doors for you? You have to ask. Or, in the case of OkCupid, you can start by simply reading their profile. OkCupid profiles have a reputation for being wonderfully detailed across countless dimensions (pronouns now included), which makes the work of getting to know somebody a whole lot easier.Bodies are complicated. Identities, even more so. By broadening pronoun options and allowing trans and queer people to list our preferred pronouns in the app, OkCupid is doing its part to break down the gender binary and ensure that everyone -- trans people, queer people, and, yes, one day, even cisgender straight people -- has access to more communicative, connected, and fabulous relationships.

It fits perfectly and even though it's made out of lacy material, it feels soft and comfortable. Usually anything with lace is itchy, scratchy and drives me crazy, but this literally feels like you're wearing a nightgown. I love how the boat neck that is supposed to lay across the tops of your shoulders actually does! The edges of the neckline have a material that has a slight stickiness so that it stays on your skin and doesn't slide off. I have small shoulders and usually can't wear this type of style because the sleeves end up just sliding off and I'm constantly pushing and tugging. This isn't like that: it fits and stays put. It's a great length, right below the knees. My daughters and husband all said 'wow' when they saw this dress.

These pictures, made during the 2000s at an unnamed Greek letter organization at the University of California, Berkeley, capture an intimate, and at times disturbing, look at the environment that shapes many of tomorrow’s leaders. The American Fraternity: An Illustrated Ritual Manual, published by Daylight Books, compiles this work within the context of US history by drawing parallels between the young men in Moisey’s pictures and the people who have helped shape the United States of America — for better or for worse. According to the book’s Indiegogo page, “Seventy-five percent of modern US presidents, senators, justices, and executives have taken arcane oaths of chivalry and allegiance” — a sobering statistic given the nature of Moisey’s photographs. Here, Moisey writes for BuzzFeed News on his motivations behind the book and shares with us a selection of his pictures in the manner he intends them to be shown — without context and accompanied by actual pages from the publication.Andrew MoiseyHave you ever noticed that the impression other countries have of America and Americans is very similar to the idea Americans have of “frat houses” and “frat boys”? Given the hubris, hypocrisy, depravity, and chauvinism that distinguishes the United States on the world stage, shouldn’t this connection be further explored? The focus of this book is on presidents of the United States, Supreme Court justices, members of Congress, CEOs, and other American leaders. The American Fraternity is really about America’s leaders as young men. At the same time, there’s a narrower focus in the book — that’s the culture inside. I had a chance to show people the intimate truth about something they’ve only seen fictionalized in movies or heard about in journalism. That’s something I wanted for this book — uncomfortable intimacy.Andrew MoiseyAndrew MoiseyWarning This image is graphic Tap to reveal Click to reveal Andrew MoiseyThis body of work began when my little brother came to Berkeley the year I was a junior and told me he wanted to join a fraternity. I had just taken an intro to photography course and was obsessed with Robert Frank, Roy DeCarava, Dorothea Lange, and Walker Evans. I carried my camera everywhere. At some point, it dawned on me that if I could be like those photographers in a place as secretive, controversial, and important as a fraternity house, I might someday wind up with a fairly valuable project.I knew a lot of brothers in the house before my little brother joined, so his membership made my presence more legitimate. I became close with several of the guys in the house. A lot of guys asked why I was taking pictures, and I said, “to make a book someday.” Some referred to it as my “coffee table book about us,” and if you look at the very last picture, you’ll see some of them enjoying the pictures that way on their giant dining table. I was appreciated enough that after a few years I’d be called up if there was going to be something interesting happening. I also promised everyone I wouldn’t use their names or their fraternity’s name. After my brother graduated I continued to shoot, and I became the outsider who knew more about the house than a lot of the brothers; I was looked up to, I felt.Andrew MoiseyAndrew MoiseyWarning This image is graphic Tap to reveal Click to reveal Andrew MoiseyAndrew MoiseyI want people to feel like they’re holding a book they were never meant to see — the total opposite of a bound art gallery, which is most photobooks. I also want them to realize something that’s not spelled out in the book. In the climactic chapter, we see the one thing I think we would miss if we finally ended fraternity culture. We would miss something that Nietzsche realized our modern, micromanaged, microaggressive world was fatally missing: wildness.Ancient Greeks and modern Greeks — fraternities, I mean — have special festivals where they worship the side of being human that is drunkenness, theater, performance, disregard for all social codes, especially respectability. For ancient Greeks that was part of the festival of Dionysus. American fraternities are the last institution in the modern world where Dionysus is found. I did not expect to come away with respect for their Dionysian festivities. I only did so after reading Nietzsche. If only what was learned in the house stayed there. But it can’t.Andrew MoiseyAndrew MoiseyAndrew MoiseyFor me, the image of the dog stands out. The way that dog is treated eliminates any hope that what happens inside the secret club of boys can stay inside the secret club of boys. The abuse has the look of a sine curve moving across the picture, into and out of it endlessly, into the dog, into the outside world, unstoppable, facilitated by vows of secrecy. That picture perfectly describes the problem of fraternities.I hope young men will look at this book and think, “Whoa. I don’t want to look like that.” I hope everyone else will at least be happy I did the project, for the sake of truth. And I hope scholars will be excited for their counterparts in the distant future who will discover this book. How I wish we had something like this book for every culture of the past.Andrew MoiseyAndrew MoiseyAndrew Moisey"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/18/11/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-4662-1537286131-7.jpg?crop=751:393;821,3124338a56c26fb4635ab86603055d096ee	['Buzzfeed Staff']		This Fall Quiz Will Reveal Your Male Celebrity Soulmate	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	This Fall Quiz Will Reveal Your Male Celebrity Soulmate	0	"Get all the best Tasty recipes in your inbox!

""That was not laughing at me. So the fake news said 'people laughed at President Trump.' They didn't laugh at me, people had a good time with me. We were doing it together, we had a good time.""Trump's comments came after Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview earlier Wednesday that those in attendance were laughing because they ""loved his honesty"" and stressed that the diplomatic community respects the president.""He's very good at knowing his audience,"" she told Fox News.But diplomats themselves described the speech as awkward and out of place.“His words in the opening part of the speech were clearly addressed to [a] domestic audience,” wrote one European diplomat in a message that noted that other world leaders do the same. “But as he did it in the Trumpian way (bragging ridiculously about being one of the best administrations in history) people in the audience reacted how they reacted.""“What would resonate well at a political rally in America sounded a little awkward at the UN General Assembly,” the diplomat added.Trump used the speech on Tuesday to hail the importance of sovereignty over multilateralism and to bash those countries that might stand in his way — all while appealing to his own American electorate.“He doesn’t have any concept of diplomacy,” one Asian diplomat said, though the diplomat added that Trump’s undiplomatic diplomacy has “worked well toward North Korea.”Trump’s chairing of a UN meeting on Wednesday morning was not met with laughter, but with confusion. The US president did discuss the ostensible subject of the meeting, touching on the Iran nuclear deal and North Korea. But he also veered into distinctly non-nonproliferation territory, accusing China of meddling in the upcoming midterm elections, while offering no proof.“They do not want me or us to win, because I am the first president to challenge China on trade,” Trump said. “And we are winning on trade. We are winning at every level.”It was the kind of tangent that would seem completely normal at a Trump rally. But at the highly scripted Security Council, it was distinctly out of place.The camera panned to the Chinese delegation, the members of which appeared to shrug.The Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the substance of Trump's speech, or on whether the shrug was an intentional reply.But the Chinese shrug encapsulated a tension that’s been on display this week as member nations‘ top officials gather to debate world events. The United Nations, home of diplomacy and decorum, is unfamiliar with the sort of brash braggadocio that’s considered par for the course for Trump.When Trump focused part of his Tuesday address on Germany and warned that “Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course,” the German delegation was caught smirking on camera.That was “scornful laughter, not nervous laughter. But there is a deeper point here: World leaders have worked out that trying to reason with Trump does not work. Trying to attack him often backfires. But laughing at him can defuse his attacks,” said Richard Gowan, a senior fellow at United Nations University.Neither the German Mission at the United Nations nor the German Embassy in Washington responded to a request for comment."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/11/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-18261-1537977472-1.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,115aa73c561ee954bacb58a785f0a04d61d	['Buzzfeed Staff']		Are You An Avril Gay?	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Are You An Avril Gay?	0	The most rare of gays is the Avril gay.

Keith Ellison Is Asking The House To Investigate An Ex-Girlfriend’s Claims That He Abused Her	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Rep. Keith Ellison Is Asking The House To Investigate An Ex-Girlfriend’s Claims That He Abused Her	0	"A growing number of Democrats say the domestic abuse allegations against Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison should be investigated, and now the House Democrat says he will request a House investigation himself.Ellison, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee and a progressive member of Congress, was accused in August of domestic abuse by his former partner, Karen Monahan, whom he dated and lived with in 2015 and 2016. Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general in Minnesota, has repeatedly denied the allegations.While he is campaigning in Minnesota, Ellison continues to serve in the House, which has so far not opened an ethics investigation or taken action against him. On Wednesday, in a statement exclusive to BuzzFeed News, Ellison said he will personally ask the House Ethics Committee to investigate the allegations.“Today I am announcing that I will submit a request for a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations against me raised by a former partner. I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved,” Ellison said. “In addition to any House Ethics investigation, an independent investigation has been conducted by an independent attorney. I have complied fully with that investigation, the results of which should be made public soon.”“These allegations have lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated. I welcome an investigation by the House to allow us to move on,” he added.Before Ellison made that announcement Wednesday, California Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat who has been outspoken throughout the #MeToo movement, told BuzzFeed News that the Ethics Committee should investigate, but she also raised questions about how effective that probe could be.“It probably should be [investigated], but you know, they won’t get it started and then he will be gone,” Speier said, referring to the fact that Ellison will leave the House in January whether he wins the attorney general race or not. “You know, it’s going to be a gesture more than anything else. We’ve got to do something with the Ethics Committee generally because when members leave, you know, the investigation falls off.”In recent days, several of Ellison’s colleagues in the House and Senate have said the allegations need to be investigated. On Sunday, Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, told CNN that there should be an investigation into Ellison’s conduct.“I have been very clear that I make no excuses for anybody who engages in this kind of behavior. And, as far as Keith Ellison, these allegations need to be investigated, and appropriate action taken,” Hirono said.Asked if he thought the allegations involving Ellison should be investigated, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine told BuzzFeed News Tuesday, “Absolutely, sure.”A spokesperson for New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who has also been outspoken on allegations of abuse and sexual harassment, told BuzzFeed News in an email Gillibrand would also support an investigation.The Minnesota Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee have already said they are looking into the allegations, but some Democrats have said that the House Ethics Committee needs to open its own probe, prior to Ellison announcing his request Wednesday.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Rep. Tim Walz, who is running for governor in Minnesota, said he supports a House Ethics investigation, and that Ellison’s decision to request one himself was the “appropriate” thing to do.“My hope is that it will be conducted in an expeditious and transparent manner. I have consistently supported investigations into sexual harassment and abuse, and I will continue to do so,” Walz said in the statement.Other members of the Minnesota delegation also said the House Ethics Committee should conduct a review.“The House Ethics Committee should conduct a comprehensive review of this matter, hearing from all parties, before Mr. Ellison retires from the House of Representatives,” Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “In the meantime, it will be up to millions of Minnesota voters to decide, based on the available information and Mr. Ellison’s record of public service, who is best to serve as their Attorney General.”“The allegations made about Rep. Ellison are very serious,” Sen. Tina Smith said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Rep. Ellison has denied them and continues to address them with the people of Minnesota. I have long supported the ongoing investigation being conducted by an outside law firm — which Rep. Ellison has cooperated with — and support the House Ethics Committee conducting an investigation as well.”Sen. Amy Klobochur’s office also indicated she would support such an investigation.That’s not to say that all Democratic members are on the same page on the issue.“I haven’t really thought about it,” Rep. Collin Peterson told BuzzFeed News Tuesday night. Asked about the allegations themselves, he said, “They need to be resolved — what’s going on? — like everything else. But whether, you know, how they deal with it — I’m not on that committee.”In a statement Wednesday afternoon, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said a House Ethics Committee investigation would be ""appropriate.""""In August, when allegations surfaced against Congressman Ellison, he immediately called for an independent investigation,"" Pelosi said. ""As that inquiry by an independent entity in Minnesota concludes, it is appropriate that the House Ethics Committee also conduct an expedited investigation of this matter, as Congressman Ellison has requested. It is essential that due process be respected and that all involved are given the opportunity to be heard."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/sub-buzz-4187-1537980663-3.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,23097fe79e4c98d48a88fc1ecdca50c32db	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Now That Bill Cosby Is Behind Bars, Attorneys Are Going To Come At Him With Civil Lawsuits	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Now That Bill Cosby Is Behind Bars, Attorneys Are Going To Come At Him With Civil Lawsuits	0	"""They want their day in court. They have waited long enough.""William Thomas Cain / Getty ImagesBill Cosby may be behind bars, but his civil legal battles are from over. Three attorneys representing the nine women who are suing Cosby with claims of defamation, sexual assault and infliction of emotional distress believe they finally have the green light to proceed with their lawsuits against the disgraced comedian after years of dragging along The three-year criminal proceeding had essentially postponed the civil lawsuits against Cosby until he was found guilty of rape, and then sentenced to between 3 and 10 years in prison. Joe Cammarata, who represents seven of the women is suing Cosby and his wife Camile for defamation said his clients have waited long enough for their day in court. The women’s civil defamation lawsuit was filed in 2014 after Green discussed in an interview allegedly being sexually assaulted by Cosby. The comedian's attorney responded by calling her allegations “absolutely false” and said the incident “did not happen in any way, shape or form.” The other women subsequently came forward with similar allegations and joined the lawsuit.Mark Makela / Getty Images From left to right, Bill Cosby accusers Caroline Heldman, Lili Bernard, and Victoria Valentino react after the guilty in April, 2018.And while each of the seven women have participated in deposition and discovery requests, submitting themselves to intense questions by Cosby’s lawyers, the 81-year-old comedian has not done the same. Cammarata said they have not been able to depose or to make any fact finding discovery from Cosby during the criminal proceedings. Now, however, he believes the court is permitted to let his case move forward and he is preparing a request for a court order to depose Cosby in prison. “My case has been on hold because of pending criminal case,” he said. “They want their day in court. They have waited long enough” Gloria Allred, who represents Judith Huth, who filed a lawsuit four years ago against Cosby for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotion distress for allegedly assaulting her in 1974 when she was 15 years old, said she is also anxious for her client’s case to move forward. “Our position is that justice delayed is justice denied,” Allred said. Allred was able to take a deposition from Cosby prior to the criminal charges being filed, but her request for a second, more in-depth deposition was stayed by the court pending the criminal case. Allred said the judge felt Cosby could have been able to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, but it's unclear even now whether Cosby will participate in a deposition because of his pending appeal. Regardless, Allred said she plans to introduce Cosby’s felony conviction in her civil lawsuit to argue against his credibility as a witness. Lisa Bloom, who represents former model Janice Dickinson, said Cosby has also eluded her attempts to question him under oath. Dickinson filed her lawsuit against Cosby and his lawyer Marty Singer claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress in May 2015. After she went public with her rape allegations against Cosby, Dickinson alleges that Cosby's team slandered her by accusing her completely fabricating the story.Matt Slocum / AP Former model Janice Dickinson gestures outside the courthouse during Bill Cosby's sentencing hearing on Sept. 25, 2018.“The court ordered him to appear for his deposition years ago, but he's always refused our attempts to get him to show up,” Bloom said. Bloom added that she is ready to press forward and ultimately obtain justice for Dickinson. “If I have to go to a Pennsylvania prison to depose him, I will. We will not give up until we get justice for Janice,” she said. “As the criminal case shows, he can delay justice, but ultimately it catches up with him.”AP Bill Cosby booking photo."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/21/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-26457-1538011470-5.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,2303039df7ee8b5431c82afa415e3736b85	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		"""Wizards Of Waverly Place"" Actor David Henrie Was Charged For Bringing A Loaded Gun Into LAX Airport"	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	"""Wizards Of Waverly Place"" Actor David Henrie Was Charged For Bringing A Loaded Gun Into LAX Airport"	0	"Former Wizards of Waverly Place actor David Henrie was charged Wednesday with three counts for bringing a loaded gun into Los Angeles International Airport.The three-count complaint is for carrying a loaded firearm, carrying a concealed firearm, and possessing a weapon in a sterile area of the airport, said Frank Mateljan, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.Henrie is scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 1. If convicted, he would face a maximum of one year in jail.Henrie, who is best known for playing Justin Russo on the Disney show opposite Selena Gomez, as well as Ted Mosby’s future son, Luke, on How I Met Your Mother, was detained in September after TSA agents found the handgun in his carry-on bag during the screening process.Henrie also did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, Los Angeles Airport Police spokesperson Rob Pedregon told BuzzFeed News. Henrie was held in custody for several hours before being released on his own recognizance.He later tweeted an apology, saying he had unintentionally brought the gun and was embarrassed over the incident.Henrie, who got married in April, posted on his Instagram this week that his wife is pregnant and expecting a baby girl.His representatives did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/wizards-of-waverly-place-actor-david-henrie-was-c-2-4168-1538002161-0_dblbig.jpg3af54282413a4e6ca49a136c4c3fcc48	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Trump’s Evidence Of Chinese Meddling In The Midterms Is An Ad In An Iowa Newspaper	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Trump’s Evidence Of Chinese Meddling In The Midterms Is An Ad In An Iowa Newspaper	0	"Stories in the ad covered topics that drew a connection between Iowans and China, like how President Xi Jinping has twice visited the state, but also less relevant ones, like news that a Chinese university would offer a course on video games.He didn’t elaborate. But later, he tweeted precisely once on the subject, noting that the Des Moines Register recently published a four-page ad from the Chinese government composed of previously published articles from the People’s Daily, a government-run newspaper.“Regrettably, we found that China is attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration,” Trump said. “They do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade. And we are winning on trade. We are winning at every level.”Addressing the United Nations Tuesday in a speech that was nominally about nuclear nonproliferation, President Trump pivoted briefly to a shocking accusation: that China was trying to swing the midterms against Republicans.China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news. That’s because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over! https://t.co/ppdvTX7oz1“It’s not surprising that China Daily sought to place advertising with the Des Moines Register, because the Register is Iowa’s largest news organization and Iowa farmers are disproportionately affected by China’s tariffs,” the Register’s executive editor, Carol Hunter said in a statement. She declined to say how much China paid for the ad.Experts largely agree that the country is deliberately targeting American farmers with tariffs in response to Trump raising tariffs on China. A recent Iowa State University study found that they could cost the state’s farming industry $2.2 billion.But it’s less clear that the tariffs are meant to help affect the midterm elections. Adam Segal, a China expert at the Council of Foreign Relations, said he viewed China’s attempts to target corn farmers as more of a broad “swing against the trade war” than a push to help elect Democrats to Congress.Later, at the UN, he told reporters China was “attacking our industrial — with ads, and with statements that don’t look like ads. It looks like they’re editorials and they’re not.”Then at a press conference Wednesday, he brought it up a third time, saying China “would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.”China, like the US and most other countries, spreads its influence in open ways, like with state-run media operations — the New York Times and Washington Post have run China Daily supplements, for example.But that falls short of “attempting to interfere” in US elections, a type of language the US intelligence community has reserved for Russia’s 2016 campaign, where military intelligence officers hacked US state voter registration databases and hacked and leaked Democrats’ emails and internal files.In recent months, several arms of the US government have geared up to fight foreign influence operations, including task forces at the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, as well as the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, which is tasked with taking the lead among the agencies. The FBI declined to comment.

Several of them, including President Donald Trump, said explicitly they do not believe the new accusations.Just one day before the Senate Judiciary Committee is planning to hear testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school, a new woman, Julie Swetnick, came forward with explosive allegations in a sworn affidavit.Swetnick, who claimed that Kavanaugh was present when she was gang-raped at a party and that he and his friend Mark Judge would regularly spike the drinks at parties to “cause girls to lose inhibitions and their ability to say ‘no.’” Swetnick is represented by Michael Avenatti — a high-profile Trump opponent who also represents porn star Stormy Daniels, who has sued the president and spoken in detail about having an affair with him.Swetnick is the third woman to go public with sexual misconduct allegations after Ford and Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s. But while Ford’s story temporarily halted the nomination process, it seems the new allegations will have no such effect. Unlike the other two cases, Swetnick’s claims have elicited a backlash from Republicans. That is in large part due to her lawyer.“The lawyer to porn stars has just taken this debacle to an even lower level. I hope people will be highly suspicious of this allegation presented by Michael Avenatti,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham in a statement.Graham dismissed the new allegations, which include that Kavanaugh attempted to get girls drunk so that they could be gang-raped at parties, as outrageous. “If Republicans bail out on this good man because of the smears and character assassination perpetrated by Michael Avenatti, we deserve our fate,” he said.In a press conference Wednesday night, Trump said that Swetnick’s accusations — as well as those of the other two women who have come forward — are “false.”“These are all false to me,” Trump said, when asked if he thought all three women were lying. “These are false accusations in certain cases and in certain cases even the media agrees with that. “Republicans also expressed doubts that Swetnick would continually attend parties where gang rapes were occurring without ever contacting the police. Sen. Tom Cotton said the allegations were “not credible,” while Sen. Bill Cassidy described the new developments as “clearly a tactic to delay, hoping we’ll push [the nomination] to after the midterms.”Graham said it was “curious” that no charges were brought forward for decades until 2018, two days before a confirmation vote. “I have a difficult time believing any person would continue to go to — according to the affidavit — ten parties over a two-year period where women were routinely gang raped and not report it. … This is outrageous, internally inconsistent, and I hope the U.S. Senate will see this for the smear campaign that it is,” he said.A spokesperson for the Republicans on the committee said committee lawyers were in the process of reviewing Swetnick’s claims. Republicans said Judiciary Committee staff have reached out to Swetnick and invited her to give a statement to committee staff. Cassidy said he expects Avenatti to block that from happening.“If she is serious about it, she will show up. If this is merely a delay tactic, what you’ll see is Avenatti make an excuse for why it can’t happen,” he said.Avenatti did not respond to a request for comment.Not all Republicans were as publicly skeptical of Swetnick’s claims. Sen. Susan Collins, a potential swing vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, said Wednesday of Swetnick’s sworn statement, “I take it very seriously.” She said she needs time to review it further.There are currently no plans for further hearings after Kavanaugh and Ford testify Thursday. A committee vote is scheduled for Friday, which could set up a final vote on the Senate floor as early as Tuesday. Democrats continue to call for an FBI investigation, but neither the White House nor Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley will grant them that wish.All eyes are on a few key Republican senators who could possibly be swing votes, such as Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Jeff Flake. It would take two Republicans to sink the nomination if every Democrat votes against Kavanaugh.Flake gave a speech on the Senate floor decrying the treatment of both Kavanaugh and the women who have made accusations against him. “These are human beings,” he said. He also chided his fellow senators for not learning from Anita Hill’s treatment during the Clarence Thomas hearings in the early 1990s.But notably, Flake did not call for the process to be slowed down or for there to be further hearings before a vote."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-14550-1537996600-7.jpg?crop=1476:772;0,21132f51e20b1a64402a5989091f18dcb36	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Senator Kirsten Gillibrand Delivered An Emotional Speech On The Kavanaugh Accusations	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Senator Kirsten Gillibrand Delivered An Emotional Speech On The Kavanaugh Accusations	0	"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand delivered a powerful speech Wednesday, calling the Republicans’ response to the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh dismissive and “so disappointing.”The Democrat’s speech on the Senate floor was referring to allegations by Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez against the judge. Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, has said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party when he was 17 and she was 15. Ramirez says Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her at a college dorm party in the 1980s.On Wednesday, a third woman, Julie Swetnick, accused the Kavanaugh of being present when she was gang-raped at a party in 1982.President Trump has been critical of Ford and Ramirez, while attacking Swetnick’s attorney on social media.Trump has “belittled and demeaned Dr. Blasey Ford and Ms. Ramirez, reminding us once again that he has been credibly accused of committing sexual assault himself and denigrates not just women who accuse him, but survivors everywhere,” the senator said.Gillibrand said that the “retaliation and scorn” that has followed the accusations is why people do not go public with similar stories.“For anyone who has ever wondered why so many survivors of sexual assault don’t come forward, obviously there’s trauma, but there’s also the fear of this very kind of retaliation and scorn,” she said.Gillibrand also criticized the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, where she said Ford has been “patronized and dismissed by some members.”“Do we value women in this country?” she asked. “Do we listen to women when they tell us about sexual trauma? Do we listen to their stories about how their lives have been forever scarred? Do we take their claims seriously or do we just disbelieve them as a matter of course?”The senator said that the process was sending “the worst possible message” to children.“It’s telling American women that your voice doesn’t matter,” she added. “It’s telling survivors everywhere that your experiences don’t count, they’re not important, and they are not to be believed. We are saying that women are worth less than a man’s promotion.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/15/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/original-13379-1537990806-3.png?crop=856:448;0,12264ac3315ba6446938b5009917ab4c684	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The EPA Just Put A Top Official On Leave. She Says They’re Trying To “Disappear” A Children’s Health Program.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The EPA Just Put A Top Official On Leave. She Says They’re Trying To “Disappear” A Children’s Health Program.	0	"A top EPA official just put on administrative leave said the Trump administration was trying to “disappear” her office dedicated to children’s health, according to an email obtained by BuzzFeed News.Ruth Etzel, the director of the Office of Children’s Health Protection and an internationally renowned expert who cowrote the field’s “bible,” was placed on administrative leave Tuesday, the New York Times first reported.“I appear to be the ‘fall guy’ for their plan to ‘disappear’ the office of children’s health,” Etzel wrote Tuesday to the leader of a nonprofit, in an email shared widely among academics and advocates.Etzel wrote that the EPA told her the decision to place her on leave was not a disciplinary action, and that it ended several months of conflict.“It had been apparent for about 5 months that the top EPA leaders were conducting ‘guerrilla warfare’ against me as the leader of OCHP, but now it’s clearly official,” Etzel wrote. Etzel did not respond to requests for comment from BuzzFeed News.The EPA declined to comment on Etzel’s email or the specifics of her leave. But a spokesperson contested the notion that the agency’s children’s health programs would be nixed.“Children’s health is and has always been a top priority for the Trump Administration and the EPA in particular is focused on reducing lead exposure in schools, providing funds for a cleaner school bus fleet, and cleaning up toxic sites so that children have safe environments to learn and play,” John Konkus, an EPA spokesperson, told BuzzFeed News by email.Konkus added that the Children’s Office, along with others like Environmental Justice and Civil Rights, “will continue to be a part of headquarters and regional organizations.”This is just the latest controversy at Trump’s EPA, which has rolled back several environmental regulations, overhauled its advisory panels, and taken down climate information on its website. These changes and more have led to low morale at the agency, and spurred hundreds of career staff to retire or leave. Trump’s first EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, left the agency in July amid a series of ethics problems, and now the agency is led by acting head Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist.Former EPA officials and other public health experts are worried about what happened to Etzel. Elizabeth “Betsy” Southerland, the former top official in EPA’s water office, said she has never heard of an office director being put on leave like this, and she’s worried this is the EPA’s first step toward suspending or firing Etzel.“I think it’s horrible,” Southerland told BuzzFeed News. “This is stunning. I’ve never seen it done at this level.”Experts outside of the government are concerned about the fate of the Children’s Health Office if Etzel does lose the job.“It leads me to the belief that EPA does not value this office,” Tracey Woodruff, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News. “I would say that the administration has already demonstrated that they are undermining the use of science in decision-making and this would be consistent with that.”Children are uniquely vulnerable to harm from environmental factors, Laura Anderko, a professor at Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies, told BuzzFeed News.“Children are not little adults — they drink more water, breath more air, eat more food,” Anderko said. During growth spurts, smaller levels of toxins can do greater damage. Also, infant behaviors — crawling, touching things, and putting their hands in their mouth — ups their exposure to environmental harms.The OCHP was established after a 1997 executive order signed by then-president Bill Clinton cited growing scientific evidence that children “suffer disproportionately from environmental health risks and safety risks,” and instructed federal agencies to assess such exposures and figure out how to minimize them.Among its roles, the OCHP publishes the “America’s Children and the Environment” reports, which pool research and national survey data on such things as illness rates, body contaminants (like blood lead levels), and environmental pollutants as they affect children, mothers, and mothers-to-be.Without the OCHP, public health experts worry that there will be less advocacy for a group that is already underserved. As an example, Anderko pointed out, “When we calculate safety levels of chemicals, we’re using adult men. Unless there are researchers at the Office of Children’s Health Protection at the table, children won’t be protected adequately.”“My fear is that they will dissolve the office,” Anderko said. “The writing is really on the wall.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/15/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/original-30786-1537991209-6.png?crop=674:352;17,974cdc41256df54b60940ef84c8819c16f	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Jane Fonda Says She Has Empathy For Trump And People Are Like, “Huh?”	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Jane Fonda Says She Has Empathy For Trump And People Are Like, “Huh?”	0	"Actor and longtime liberal activist Jane Fonda expressed sympathy for President Donald Trump on Wednesday during an interview with Politico in which she encouraged his opponents to empathize with him.On the latest episode of the Women Rule podcast, Fonda said Americans should practice “radical kinship” for the president and his followers.Though Fonda did say that she hates what Trump “stands for,” as well as “what he does [and] what he says,” she believes she understands why he behaves the way he does.“I feel that I understand a little bit — this is a man who was traumatized as a child by his father, who had a mother that didn’t protect him,” Fonda said. “And the behavior is the language of the wounded.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-31397-1537983679-1.jpg?crop=726:380;109,10467e74630dec3497897b04061e26c0735	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The Trump Administration Is Still Trying To Stop Pregnant Undocumented Teens From Getting Abortions	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The Trump Administration Is Still Trying To Stop Pregnant Undocumented Teens From Getting Abortions	0	"The Trump administration was back in court Wednesday arguing that the government should have the power to stop pregnant, undocumented teenagers in US custody from getting abortions.A federal judge in late March entered an injunction that prohibits officials from interfering with access to abortion or information about abortion for pregnant teens in immigration detention. The order also blocks the administration from telling anyone, including a parent, about a teen’s pregnancy or decision to terminate the pregnancy against the teen’s wishes.Arguing before the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on Wednesday, Justice Department attorney August Flentje said that the judge’s order, which also approved the case as a class action covering all pregnant teens in immigration custody, not just those who asked for an abortion or expressed interest, would require government agencies and officials to act “inconsistent with their profound respect for life.”“This is an unprecedented expansion of abortion jurisprudence,” Flentje argued.Flentje was grilled by the three-judge panel for nearly an hour and 20 minutes, far beyond the 20 minutes the court said each side would have to argue. Judge Sri Srinivasan led the questioning and pressed Flentje about how, under the government’s preferred policy, the only way a teen could exercise the right to abortion that exists in the United States was to either be released to a sponsor — which might not be possible — or to leave the United States.Once the teen left the country, Srinivasan said, “the right is gone.”Flentje argued that the government was allowed to place restrictions on individuals who crossed the border illegally, which meant they couldn’t exercise constitutional rights in the same way as individuals who weren’t in custody. Srinivasan asked if the government could apply that same logic to deny adult women in immigration custody the ability to get an abortion, and Flentje said he thought that was correct. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a policy of allowing adult women in its custody to get abortions.)Flentje argued Wednesday that the government didn’t have a policy of prohibiting teens in custody from getting abortions — it was a case-by-case decision, he said. Judge Robert Wilkins asked if there was any instance where officials had granted an abortion request. Flentje said no.ACLU lawyer Brigitte Amiri pointed out that the district judge concluded ORR’s practices were almost entirely rooted in an ideological opposition to abortion, which undercut the government’s argument that these were case-by-case determinations.Separate from the merits of the injunction, the DC Circuit will also consider the government’s arguments that the class certified by the judge is too broad, and that the case is moot because the teens who were originally named as plaintiffs are no longer seeking abortions. Wilkins and Judge Laurence Silberman both suggested they had concerns the case was now moot and expressed concerns that the judge’s decision to include all pregnant teens, and not just those seeking abortion or who expressed interest in abortion, in the class.The court has a number of options for what kind of order it can fashion. In addition to all-or-nothing opinions in favor of one side, the judges could issue an order, for instance, that the lower court judge narrow the scope of the class, in a way that leaves the injunction in place.The case has a complicated history in the federal courts. It began with claims filed in October 2017 by a single pregnant teen in US custody, referred to by the pseudonym Jane Doe, who sued in order to obtain an abortion. The trial judge handling the case, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, entered a temporary restraining order in Jane Doe’s favor, which the government immediately appealed.The DC Circuit ultimately sided with Jane Doe, and she obtained an abortion before the government was able to petition the US Supreme Court to intervene; Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissent to that decision, which has become a flashpoint in the fight over his pending nomination to the Supreme Court.The case nevertheless did go before the justices, who issued an order in June vacating the DC Circuit’s opinion. The Supreme Court’s order didn’t end the case — it just meant that the DC Circuit’s earlier opinion was not binding precedent as the case went forward in the lower courts.Early on in the case, Jane Doe’s lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union had asked the judge to certify the case as a class action, and to have the case cover all pregnant teenagers in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which manages the care of undocumented minors. The judge didn’t rule on that request for months, and in the meantime, the court fielded more emergency claims filed by the ACLU on behalf of individual pregnant teens.Wilkins asked Flentje Wednesday if the government could deprive undocumented immigrants of other constitutional rights, such as the right to counsel or a jury trial in criminal cases, by saying that immigrants could leave the country if they didn’t want that kind of trial. Flentje said that would be unconstitutional, and that cases involving abortion access were unique — the Supreme Court made clear that the government didn’t have to commit resources to facilitate abortion, and that principle was “closely linked” to the decision to block undocumented teens from getting access to abortion, he said. The government has argued that allowing teens to get abortions is facilitation, even in cases where the government isn’t paying for the procedure or to transport the teen.Flentje also argued that Chutkan’s order made it impossible for the government to have any policy about how to handle teens seeking abortions, including setting guidelines for how much time the government could have to try to find a sponsor. Srinivasan and Wilkins questioned whether it was the appeals court’s role to step in and say what an acceptable time frame would be.Srinivasan asked if the government could make a teen who asked for an abortion early in her pregnancy wait longer than a teen who was getting close to the time when an abortion wouldn’t be possible. Flentje said those were factors that would be considered.On the class issue, Wilkins pressed Amiri on how a teen who wanted to carry her pregnancy to term had been injured by the government’s policies, which seemed aimed at teens who asked for an abortion or expressed interest. Amiri said that the government had restricted teens from getting “neutral” information about pregnancy options, and that narrowing the class would unfairly place the burden on teens — who may not speak English or be aware of their options — to make an affirmative decision in order to get the court’s protections.There was also a potential issue for all pregnant teens with respect to a parent being notified about their pregnancy against their wishes, Amiri said, although she acknowledged they didn’t have concrete information about how that was being handled because they hadn’t gotten to the phase of the case where they’d be entitled to evidence from the government.On whether the case was moot, Amiri argued that the unknowns in these types of cases — including how long a teen would be in custody and when she could no longer get an abortion — meant the case was “transitory” and that the court should keep the case live even if the claims no longer applied to the original plaintiffs. She also argued that voluntary departure wasn’t a cure-all, saying that it could still take several weeks or even months for a minor to be removed from the United States.Amiri said that since the March 30 order, the ACLU was anecdotally aware of at least 12 pregnant teens in immigration detention who had asked for an abortion or expressed interest in an abortion or initiating state proceedings to bypass parental consent laws. There continued to be minors in custody who would be harmed if the judge’s injunction were lifted, she said.“This is a blanket ban on abortion for anyone while they’re in government custody,” she said."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/14/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/the-trump-administration-is-still-trying-to-stop--2-1660-1537987361-4_dblbig.jpg31600f56309b47dab3b05e4666dacd13	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		David Hogg Said That He Wants To Speak To Trump	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	David Hogg Said That He Wants To Speak To Trump	0	"David Hogg, in an interview with BuzzFeed News on Tuesday, said that he regrets not attending the White House listening session following the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and that he would “love” to speak to the president.“I would love to speak to him at this point,” the March for Our Lives activist said.The White House didn’t immediately respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment.Over the summer, Hogg, along with a coalition of anti–gun violence activists from across the country, embarked on a nationwide tour called “Road to Change” to register young voters and to engage with those who disagree with their activism around gun violence. The activist told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that this experience was part of the reason why he now wishes to speak with Trump.“I’ve learned over the course of traveling the country how to directly address the issues with the dissenting opinions on our policy and I would welcome the opportunity to tell the president to his face how he could save lives,” Hogg said.Hogg said that he wants to speak to the administration to discuss March for Our Lives’ 10-point plan, which includes funding for gun violence research and universal background checks.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in June that the school safety commission, created by the administration following the shooting in Parkland, Florida, will not focus on the role guns play in campus violence.Hogg was invited to attend Trump’s “listening session” following the shooting, but hung up on the White House, he said on Bill Maher’s HBO show in March.“I ended on this message with them — I said, we don’t need to listen to President Trump. President Trump needs to listen to the screams of the children and the screams of this nation,” Hogg said.A number of people from the Florida high school attended the session, including a dad whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow Pollack, died in the massacre. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot?” Andrew Pollack asked during the emotional meeting. “It stops here with this administration and me.”Hogg said that he was “so emotional” after the massacre at his school, and that he now regrets not attending the listening session. On Bill Maher's show in March, he said the call was “very offensive considering the fact that there were funerals the next day; there was mourning we still had to do.”Most recently, March for Our Lives partnered with mayors across the country to make it easier for young people to register to vote. Hogg told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that the group has a plan, to be announced soon, that will encourage people to show up to the polls on Election Day.So far, Hogg said, the group has registered roughly 30,000 people since creating their QR-code merch, which directs people to the March for Our Lives website when scanned."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/13/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/david-hogg-says-that-he-would-love-to-speak-with--2-7320-1537984635-10_dblbig.jpg6bdef6fcb2094377a1bb740bdd8fdf24	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		A Man Suspected Of Killing Homeless Men In California Was Previously Deported Six Times	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	A Man Suspected Of Killing Homeless Men In California Was Previously Deported Six Times	0	"A man has been arrested in connection with the vicious beating deaths of primarily homeless men in the Los Angeles area earlier this month, three of whom have died.Ramon Alberto-Escobar, 47, was arrested on Monday and is suspected of three deaths, as well as attacks on four other men.He was arrested after he allegedly beat a sleeping homeless man with bolt cutters in Santa Monica, police officials said on Tuesday.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Alberto-Escobar, an El Salvador national, has been deported six times between 1997 and 2011, and has six felony convictions.""After illegally reentering the U.S. following his most recent removal Alberto-Escobar filed an appeal of his immigration case with the Board of Immigration Appeals in June 2016, which the courts granted in December 2016.

Starbucks, Subway, and the other chain stores were still closed, so the few early risers grabbed their coffee at the only store open: Jax Donut House.The parking lot was mostly empty, except for one spot, 50 feet from the US Bank drive thru, where nearly two dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were strapping on black “POLICE” vests and guns. They were in the middle of a three-day operation that would spread across Southern California and multiple counties. More than 100 officers would be involved in the action, in which 150 undocumented immigrants were arrested — all but 14 were convicted criminals, according to the preliminary data released by the agency. ICE claims the sweeps at homes and outside businesses are necessary because California’s sanctuary laws don’t allow county jails to hold prisoners past their release dates so that ICE can pick them up. Rarely can county officials notify ICE in advance of when someone will be released. So ICE says it must send officers into cities like Anaheim to find undocumented immigrants who have criminal convictions or deportation orders against them. Potentially, undocumented immigrants with no criminal background also are swept up. The raids have made ICE unpopular with immigrant advocates who say that the ICE presence spreads fear in the lives of people who are merely trying to get by. But ICE officials say the characterization of its officers as brute-force rounding up innocents is inaccurate and unfair. To make that point, ICE invited BuzzFeed News to ride along as it began its operation to see how the raids are conducted. “It feels like we’re the bad guys to everyone,” said one ICE officer who declined to give his name as he described how the intense public focus on his agency has made him careful in public and to never talk about his work.Dania Maxwell for BuzzFeed News ICE agents stake out a neighborhood hoping to make a targeted arrest Sept. 24 in Orange County, California.Under the Trump administration, arrests of noncriminals have increased across the country after an executive order pushed the focus of ICE beyond just those with felonies and recent deportation orders, among other limits. Under an order signed by President Trump, nearly every undocumented immigrant can be a priority if they are encountered by ICE officers. And unlike in previous years, officers are authorized to make “collateral arrests,” meaning undocumented family members or friends found in a target’s home. “There was a line in the sand of who our targets were and who weren’t [targets],” said Thomas Giles, the acting director of the Los Angeles field office, which spans seven counties in Southern California, referring to instructions during the Obama administration that limited ICE operations to certain convicted criminals. Under the Trump administration, those limits have been lifted. “We just enforce the immigration law the way it was written,” Giles said. The officers at the Anaheim strip mall have a list of targets for arrest that includes their suspected addresses, descriptions, and photos. Surveillance has detailed their routines. An ICE supervisor lays out a series of maps on the hood of a car. It shows an aerial view of the workplace of one target. The supervisor explains how he wants his officers in cars to surround the building so that they can grab the target when he arrives. Much of the job is mundane, hours of waiting for the target to appear. In this case, he never did.Dania Maxwell for BuzzFeed News Scenes from an ICE stakeout.Jorge Field, the assistant director of the Los Angeles field office, knows that mundane aspect well. He’s been enforcing the nation’s immigration laws for 23 years. Monday morning, he’d parked his SUV in an industrial part of Anaheim, a few miles from the strip mall, waiting for a suspect to show up. The man had been convicted of possession of a firearm, drunk driving, and battery. A stocky, middle-aged man with a thick, salt-and-pepper goatee, Field is offended by the calls to abolish the agency he’s spent much of his adult life working for. He feels caught between two competing sides, those who think ICE does too much and those who think it doesn’t do nearly enough. “Ninety percent of the population hates what we do,” he sighs. “Forty-five percent think we’re doing too much, and 45% think we need to do more. Who’s right and who’s wrong? Who knows.” Field thinks the agency is battling misconceptions that have shaped public opinion. “If you listen to advocates, we’re out on every street corner, stopping every brown person there is. We have a few hundred officers to cover 36,000 square miles, 20 million people. Do we have the resources to be on every street corner? Absolutely not.” Field, who wears a gray bracelet to honor his child who died of a brain tumor more than a decade ago, also bristles at some of the president’s disparaging remarks about immigrants. “My dad is from Mexico. My uncles came from there. So, do I think people coming from Mexico are the worst of the worst? Obviously not,” he said, referring to Trump’s infamous first speech as a presidential candidate in which he said Mexico did not send its “best” but instead rapists and criminals. “It’s just like the left that makes a generalized statement, so does the right.” He figures about 40% of ICE officers in Los Angeles are Latino. That, he said, goes against how officers are depicted as “blonde hair, blue-eyed, jack-booted Aryans.” After waiting more than 30 minutes, officers figured the target wouldn’t show up to work and decided to go to his presumed home, where they’d seen him coming out with his motorcycle. It was a modest neighborhood, with cramped, beige homes shielded by short white and black fences. A barbecue grill was on the front lawn of one home. Christmas lights were still up on another.Dania Maxwell for BuzzFeed News ICE agents prepare to make an arrest.ICE officers, one armed with a rifle, walked deliberately between a few homes around an alley where they’d seen him, knocking on doors looking for the target. Some didn’t open their doors, while others told the officers they had come to the wrong place. As the officers fanned out, kids passed on their way to school, onlookers appeared from neighboring homes, and those who drove by stopped and asked, “What’s going on here?” After searching for a bit, the bulk of the officers left — on to the next target, a man in Fullerton, just a few miles away. This time, it took just a knock on the door. The target, wearing a white tank top and basketball shorts, opened up. Officers quickly cuffed him, put him in a car, and left. The apartment building was across from a Catholic school. Field believes it would be a better use of resources if they could pick up inmates before they were released from jails, like in the past, when counties were allowed to hold inmates ICE wanted. After all, once an individual is arrested, their fingerprints are compared with prints in federal databases that alert immigration authorities if the person is wanted. Proponents of sanctuary laws that limit local cooperation with immigration enforcement say such policies allow all people — regardless of immigration status — to engage with public services, including police protection, education, and health care, rather than live in the shadows. “Do these people really have sanctuary here?” Field said. “It doesn’t stop us from doing our job. So is that a misnomer? Absolutely.” While the majority of those targeted in the operation in Southern California were convicted criminals, and the office still arrests mostly criminals, an increasing number of people in other parts of the country have been picked up with no such background and with deep ties to the country — including children who are American citizens. “I mean, do I empathize with them? Kind of. At the end of the day, again, everything we do has consequences,” Field said. “If I know that I’m coming to the country improperly, and I know the result of that could be one day I’ll be arrested, where does the responsibility lie for what happens at the end?” Immigration enforcement, he said, is like a roller-coaster, going up and down based on the administration. Field has seen it all, dating back to then-president Bill Clinton. Under Obama, he said, the priorities of whom ICE was to target gave false hope to a segment of the undocumented population. “It gave those people a false sense of security,” he said. Obama administration officials believed their approach utilized ICE’s finite resources to focus on those unauthorized immigrants with the worst criminal records, as opposed to those who were largely upstanding members of society. At an ICE facility in Los Angeles, the arrestees in the operation were shackled and cuffed, lined up sitting on a bench, their belongings in plastic bags on the floor, as their information and fingerprints were processed. They’d later be placed in one of several holding cells on the same floor, depending on whether they were to be deported immediately or transferred to an ICE detention center in the state or across the country. One of the targets in the sweep, Freddy Vasquez, 35, had been convicted of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, failure to register as a sex offender, driving under the influence, and possession of a controlled substance. He said he’d been working and had been in this country since he was a teenager. Even though he was set to be deported again, Vasquez said he would try to come back from Mexico. “I need to,” he said. “There’s no life over there.” Meanwhile, Santos Sierra Tamayo, 39, who had been deported three times before and was convicted of vehicle theft and possession of a controlled substance, said he’d been waiting to get picked up for his work as a house painter when ICE showed up and arrested him. Ever since then, he’d been thinking how and when he was going to tell his four children about his imminent deportation to Mexico. He didn’t know if his family had figured out that he’d been picked up. He didn’t think he’d have the opportunity to ever come back. “I’m thinking I lost them,” he said. “I lost my family.”Dania Maxwell for BuzzFeed News ICE prisoners are booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-12399-1537981774-1.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230d50c400323964221ad7bda9314a8a073	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		A Third Woman Has Accused Brett Kavanaugh Of Sexual Misconduct, And Said He Was Present When She Was Gang-Raped	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	A Third Woman Has Accused Brett Kavanaugh Of Sexual Misconduct, And Said He Was Present When She Was Gang-Raped	0	"A third woman has come forward to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, and said in a sworn declaration that the Supreme Court nominee was present when she was gang-raped at a party in 1982.Julie Swetnick said in the declaration, submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, that Kavanaugh and his friends, including Mark Judge, helped spike the drinks of girls at high school house parties to “cause girls to lose inhibitions and their ability to say ‘no.’”“I also witnessed efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in the side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys,” she wrote.“I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room,” she said, adding that “these boys included” Kavanaugh.“This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone. I don’t know who this is and this never happened,” Kavanaugh said in a statement sent by the White House.In response to the new allegations, the White House released a letter signed by 60 of Kavanaugh's high school classmates calling the accusation ""nonsense"" and the tumultuous confirmation process ""a disgrace."" They say they ""never witnessed any behavior that even approaches what is described in this allegation"" nor did they ever meet Swetnick. The letter is similar to one written in response to the first allegations against Kavanaugh attesting to his character and signed by 65 women who said they knew him.Swetnick’s description of events is similar to what Judge’s ex-girlfriend, Elizabeth Rasor, told the New Yorker. She recalled Judge telling her about an incident from high school involving him and others taking turns having sex with a drunk girl. Rasor said Judge viewed it as consensual.“Mr. Judge vehemently denies Ms. Swetnick’s allegations,” lawyer Barbara Van Gelder told BuzzFeed News.Swetnick wrote that she was gang-raped by a group of boys at a party in 1982 — and that Kavanaugh was present.“During the incident I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me,” she wrote. “I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes or something similar placed in what I was drinking.”Swetnick is a Washington, DC, resident who has worked for the federal government — including in jobs with the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Homeland Security — and holds a security clearance. She said she first met Kavanaugh and Judge in the early 1980s when she was introduced to them at a house party in the DC area.She estimated that she attended approximately 10 house parties at which Kavanaugh and Judge were present, and where she says she saw him drink excessively and act aggressively toward girls including “not taking ‘no’ for an answer.”She said their conduct included “the fondling and grabbing of girls without their consent.”Swetnick said she witnessed Kavanaugh pressing girls against him, “grinding” against girls, and attempting to remove or shift girls’ clothing to expose their body parts.Swetnick's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, told BuzzFeed News that Swetnick reached out to him for representation — making her the third woman to publicly accuse the Supreme Court nominee of sexual misconduct.Kavanaugh was also verbally abusive to women, Swetnick alleges. She said she observed him making crude sexual comments “designed to demean, humiliate, and embarrass” the girls.On Monday, when Fox News asked Kavanaugh about Avenatti’s general allegations — before Swetnick came forward — the judge called it “totally false and outrageous."" ""I never done any such thing, known about any such thing,"" he said. “And yes, people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school — I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit.”A spokesperson for Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, confirmed receiving Swetnick's declaration.“Committee lawyers are in the process of reviewing it now,” the spokesperson said.Grassley later tweeted that approximately 20 committee investigators are tracking down all allegations, talking to all witnesses, and gathering all evidence. He added that experienced federal agents are working alongside congressional investigators.Avenatti told MSNBC he first approached the Senate committee on Sunday with his client’s allegations. After supplying “detailed correspondence” to them on Monday, he said he never heard back, prompting him to release his client’s sworn statement to the public on Wednesday.Avenatti said that, like Kavanaugh’s other accusers, Swetnick wants an FBI investigation into her claims.“The allegations in this declaration are shocking. They are also detailed, and my client stands behind them 100%,” Avenatti said.“She has been fully vetted time and time again, and she is an honest and courageous woman,” he said.He also cautioned Republicans, and Kavanaugh himself, not to attack his client.“If they try to come after my client or engage in some smear campaign, they better pack a lunch because we're going to respond twofold,” he said. “We are going to respond double as it relates to force. So they better be very careful before they start spewing nonsense and trying to call my client a liar.”A judiciary committee hearing is set for Thursday to hear the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, now a professor at Palo Alto University, who has said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party when he was 17 and she was 15.Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh in the 1980s, told the New Yorker in a piece published Sunday that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her at a college dormitory party when he was 18 years old.President Trump has defended Kavanaugh, calling him “an absolute gem.” The president had previously referred to the allegations against Kavanaugh as “false accusations.”Trump tweeted on Wednesday that Avenatti — Swetnick's lawyer and a prominent critic of the Trump administration who represented Stormy Daniels — ""is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh.""President Trump has previously admitted to reimbursing his former lawyer Michael Cohen $130,000 for a 2016 hush agreement negotiated by him in relation to Daniels' alleged relationship with Trump.Sen. Chuck Schumer called on Republicans to suspend Kavanaugh's nomination and for Trump to order the FBI to open Kavanaugh's background check investigation. And Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Trump should withdraw the nomination."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/16/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/a-third-woman-has-accused-brett-kavanaugh-of-sexu-2-28611-1537994982-0_dblbig.jpgf5045dc78af649e5900b15d5fd0f0b8d	['Buzzfeed News Europe Editor']		Italy Asked About Weakening Sanctions Against Russia At A Closed-Door Meeting Of European Diplomats	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Italy Asked About Weakening Sanctions Against Russia At A Closed-Door Meeting Of European Diplomats	0	"LONDON — Italy demanded EU leaders discuss loosening sanctions against Russia at a closed-door meeting of European diplomats earlier this month, according to two written accounts of the meeting seen by BuzzFeed News.At the meeting of EU ambassadors, which took place in Brussels on Sept. 12, the Italian envoy asked counterparts to include the issue of European banks lending to Russia on the agenda of the next European Council meeting of EU heads of government and state, which will take place next month in the Belgian capital.The Italian request will further raise concerns and questions about the government’s relationship with Moscow. Diplomats have previously told BuzzFeed News that they can’t understand why Italy’s new government prioritizes the issue to the extent that it does.“The Italian government seems anxious to exit the European mainstream and constantly highlight differences. An Italy that seeks trouble is, however, the exact opposite of our interests as a country,” said Filippo Sensi, former spokesperson for two Italian ex–prime ministers, Matteo Renzi and Paolo Gentiloni.Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and deputy prime minister, who has for years campaigned extensively for stopping the sanctions, has repeatedly called for dropping the measures since taking office earlier this year.

However, it imposed restrictions on key sections of the program.A three-judge majority on a panel of five judges struck down sections of a law that allowed private companies like banks and mobile phone carriers in India to ask people for an Aadhaar ID before providing services. The judges also ruled that India’s government could not require people to ask for an Aadhaar ID for peripheral issues like identifying students taking exams. However, Indians will still be required to enroll in the program for paying income tax and accessing government-provided welfare services.The decade-old Aadhaar program was conceived as a voluntary identity system for millions of Indians who didn’t have any form of ID and was positioned by the Indian government as a way to stamp out corruption in the country’s welfare systems. In 2009, India began storing the personal details — such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and mobile numbers, along with biometric data like scans of all 10 fingerprints and irises — of every Indian resident in a centralized database. The idea was to have a simple fingerprint or an iris scan establish a person’s identity quickly.But over time, India’s government and private companies have made having an Aadhaar ID effectively mandatory by requiring it for everything from getting government subsidies to opening new bank accounts and getting cellphone connections. Some 1.2 billion Indians — nearly the entire population of the country — are now enrolled in Aadhaar.Advocates of the program, such as its founder, Indian billionaire Nandan Nilekani, have said that having a digital ID based on biometric data would provide millions of Indians with a national ID for the first time, as well as help private companies provide services to them quickly and efficiently. Before Aadhaar, millions of Indians lacked government identification such as driving licenses and passports, locking them out of crucial services like insurance and pensions.But critics have slammed Aadhaar for violating people’s privacy, exposing citizens to identity theft, and its potential to enable state surveillance. Earlier this year, the Aadhaar database was reportedly breached after a reporter from an Indian newspaper was able to buy access to the entire database for just $8. Since then, private information from Aadhaar has leaked on the internet dozens of times.Aadhaar’s critics have also said that the program leads to exclusion if someone’s fingerprint or iris scan doesn’t work. A HuffPost report said that 27 people have died of starvation in India since 2015 after being locked out of the program for various reasons.India’s Supreme Court, however, passed a majority judgment calling Aadhaar “unique” and “unparalleled,” and said that it empowered marginalized Indians who were locked out of the system for not having any form of national ID. Justice Dhananjaya Chandrachud, one of the two judges on the five-judge panel, however, dissented strongly against Aadhaar, calling the entire program ""unconstitutional,"" and asked private companies who have already collected the Aadhaar-linked demographic data of Indian residents to destroy it."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/5/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/original-16154-1537955601-2.jpg?crop=1250:655;0,78a98f93c3ceea4a46ad5769d38afe7283	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		An Arizona Prosecutor Will Question Brett Kavanaugh And Christine Blasey Ford For The GOP	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	An Arizona Prosecutor Will Question Brett Kavanaugh And Christine Blasey Ford For The GOP	0	"A leading sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona will ask questions on behalf of Republicans at Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where a woman will testify about an alleged sexual assault committed by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Rachel Mitchell is on leave as chief of the special victims division in the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and has decades of experience as a prosecutor. Her duties include supervising attorneys prosecuting child molestation and sexual assault cases in Phoenix and the surrounding cities, as well as working on sex crimes legislation and standards for prosecutors.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier Tuesday that Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee — all of whom are men — wanted to bring in a woman to ask questions for them in order to keep the hearing respectful.""We have hired a female assistant to go on staff and to ask these questions in a respectful and professional way,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We want this hearing to be handled very professionally, not a political sideshow like you saw put on by the Democrats when they were questioning Judge Kavanaugh.""Specifically, Mitchell will serve as the nomination investigative counsel for Republicans, Senate Judiciary chair Chuck Grassley said in a statement. The decision was made in the shadow of another Supreme Court nomination hearing: the 1991 proceedings where Anita Hill testified that then-nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her at work. Senators on the committee, exclusively men at that time, repeatedly asked Hill intimate questions, creating an atmosphere that critics described as a sham trial and misogynistic.""As I have said, I’m committed to providing a forum to both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday that is safe, comfortable, and dignified,"" Grassley said.He added that Mitchell would be an experienced and objective questioner, which he hoped would ease the fears of Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, in coming forward. Ford, who has said Kavanaugh assaulted her at a high school party, has experienced death threats and other harassment.""I promised Dr. Ford that I would do everything in my power to avoid a repeat of the ‘circus’ atmosphere in the hearing room that we saw the week of September 4,"" Grassley said. ""I’ve taken this additional step to have questions asked by expert staff counsel to establish the most fair and respectful treatment of the witnesses possible.”In Arizona, Mitchell has helped write standards for investigators and prosecutors handling child abuse or sexual assault cases. She advocated for allowing child victims to testify in court with emotional support dogs. In 2006, she was Maricopa County's prosecutor of the year, and she's also been recognized for her work with victims and children.In a statement late Tuesday, Maricopa County Attorney's Office said that Mitchell is ""professional, fair, objective, and has a caring heart for victims.""""She has been instrumental in developing protocols for the investigation of child abuse and sexual assault cases enhancing the ability for victims to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect while holding offenders accountable,"" it added.Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said: ""The American people can be confident that Rachel Mitchell’s experience as a conscientious prosecutor, trained to seek justice, protect victims, and pursue truth, will assist the Senate Judiciary Committee in performing its important task."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/26/9/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/an-arizona-prosecutor-will-question-brett-kavanau-2-14889-1537967024-0_dblbig.jpgd7e3dd99ffa341f08bee96ab0e3a3050	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Scientists Warned Of Rising Seas In North Carolina. Now The State Is Dealing With A Disaster.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Scientists Warned Of Rising Seas In North Carolina. Now The State Is Dealing With A Disaster.	0	"Thousands more homes were damaged by Florence because of rising seas, scientists said. Six years ago, North Carolina Republicans voted to ban sea-level rise science.Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images A man wades through about three feet of floodwater at his father's home in Kinston, North Carolina.Six years after North Carolina lawmakers banned the use of a scientific report that predicted accelerated sea level rises due to climate change, researchers said this week that storm surge from Hurricane Florence damaged twice as many homes because of consistently swelling seas and inadequately adapted developments. Since the powerful storm walloped the Carolina coast on Sept. 14, the storm has left at least 43 people dead and caused billions of dollars in damage. Several rivers in North Carolina are still overflowing into bordering towns, cutting off aid to residents and spurring new evacuations.In a report published Monday, scientists at the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit sea level research and communications group, found that since 1970 sea levels off the coast of the Carolinas rose 6 inches, causing storm surge from Florence to ""significantly affect"" more than 11,000 additional homes when it slammed into the region nearly two weeks ago. Large chunks of the state are still battling record-level flooding and thousands of people remain evacuated and without power.The researchers gathered the data from a host of federal organizations, including the US Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as local governments in hard-hit coastal regions and historical elevation data to assess how Florence impacted communities when compared with past storms. By mapping the storm surge heights against elevation and property data, researchers concluded that Florence's storm surge impacted more than 51,000 homes. ""Tons more homes were affected and the damage is still being assessed, but we can already see what a tremendous impact storm surge had on these communities,"" Steven McAlpine, First Street's head of data science, told BuzzFeed News. ""Even elevated homes were impacted.""Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Homes are inundated after a storm surge from Hurricane Florence flooded the Neuse River, Sept. 14, 2018, in New Bern, North Carolina.In 2010, scientists from the North Carolina Resources Commission published a report estimating that sea levels along the coast would rise 39 inches over the next century due to climate change, potentially putting 2,000 square miles of the coast underwater. Real estate groups and conservative lawmakers balked at the predictions, accusing the panel of ""pulling data out of their hip pocket."" Backed by major developers, the Republican legislature banned state and local agencies from creating any policies using that report, or any other scientific findings on sea level rise prior to July 2016, when the commission's next report would be updated.Instead, state policies surrounding sea level predictions could only be based on ""historical data,"" despite multiple, recent scientific studies touting the same findings about sea level rise. In another report from August 2017, the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that 20 coastal North Carolina communities could be submerged in the next 15 years. ""The mindset has been all economics, growth and development at all costs,"" said Stanley Riggs, a professor at East Carolina University and a former member of the commission that produced the report. ""They keep pushing for bigger and bigger coastal developments and then trying to build dikes and pile sandbags around towns consistently more at risk of flooding. It's insane.""First Street FoundationBy 2050, the sea along the North Carolina coast is predicted to rise 15 inches higher than current levels, First Street said in its findings. As a result, the same storm surge from Florence would approximately double its impact, flooding approximately 102,000 homes.Denser, broadening communities also played a significant role in how rainfall and storm surge from Florence swallowed entire neighborhoods, with many more homes directly in the storm's path than there were about 50 years ago. ""About 28,000 of the 51,000 homes damaged in the area were built after 1970,"" McAlpine said. ""We will, most likely based on trends, continue to develop into at-risk areas and this storm highlights that we need to do it smartly. Otherwise, we will continue to experience worse and worse damage."" The riverfront city of New Bern, for example, has been devastated by storm surge and extraordinary, ongoing flooding. Although the extent of the damage is still being assessed, officials said Friday that Florence caused $74.5 million in residential damages and $25 million more to businesses. ""I have never seen anything like this,"" New Bern Mayor Dana Outlaw, who has lived in North Carolina his entire life, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday. ""Hurricane Floyd hit us in a different way. This one, the storm surge really got us like nothing before."" While Outlaw did concede that ""empirical data"" does show that the sea levels hugging his state are rising, he believes that storms like Florence are ""anomalies that you can't predict.""Nevertheless, he said that standards in the state need to change and he would like to see the governor and legislature hold regional meetings, ""put politics aside and do the right thing."" ""This storm will make a believer out of a lot of folks,"" Outlaw said. ""It's a wake-up call for new building standards. We have to be smart about this and make some tough decisions. They will be unpopular ones, but we all need to take a closer look at this and get the homeowner groups and all on the same side to make some changes."" Heavy flooding from Florence also crippled communities farther inland, despite repeated attempts to prepare aging levy systems and damns for the rising water. The city of Lumberton, for example, erected temporary levees to try to keep the Lumber river from pouring into its streets. They gave way.This is where water flooded into the city of Lumberton, NC two yrs ago during Hurricane Matthew. Volunteers, city employees and the National Guard worked furiously today to “put a cork in this hole,” as the deputy dir of public works Corey Walters put it to me today https://t.co/wJyYVE9KneAs communities like New Bern and Lumberton scurried to prepare as Florence loomed off the coast, North Carolina's 2012 decision to ban scientific predictions of sea level changes again drew national coverage and outrage.""We now have communities farther inland who had asked for help and now they are like a swimming pool,"" Riggs said. ""People are in desperation trying to figure out how to pump water out of their cities and this is just going to keep happening.""Riggs, McAlpine, and other scientists say ignoring rising sea levels is ""irresponsible"" and will ""wipe out towns"" still trying to recover from previous powerful storms, such as Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Residents who have weathered and rebounded from past storms say they are seeing flooding in places they had not expected. ""I came back home for the first time since I left last week and everything is wiped out,"" Patricia Clifton, who lives in Lumberton, told BuzzFeed News. ""This is devastating because I, we feel like we are reliving Matthew all over again but so much worse, and so many of us don't have the heart or money to come back from this."""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-5527-1537897821-1.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230cc4ccfb5a9e14f0aabcd26c74be6843d	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Brett Kavanaugh’s Yale Classmates Remember Him In A “Drinky Crowd”	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Brett Kavanaugh’s Yale Classmates Remember Him In A “Drinky Crowd”	0	"In his college years, Brett Kavanaugh was ingrained in a social world that centered around alcohol, according to classmates who knew him at Yale, joining a notorious fraternity on a campus where few took part in Greek life and an all-male secret society that had a reputation solely for members’ heavy drinking.It’s an image that contrasts with the that one Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, has sometimes presented of himself.Kavanaugh turned Monday night to Fox News to defend himself against multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, including an allegation from his time at Yale, where a classmate, Debbie Ramirez, said Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her during one alcohol-soaked night their freshman year.In the interview with Fox, Kavanaugh said he had “never” drunk alcohol to the point of blacking out — ruling out the possibility that he had forgotten about any incidents of misconduct. Some of his Yale classmates, though, said their memories of Kavanaugh as a heavy and frequent drinker conflicted with the judge’s assertions.Kavanaugh, who will testify in a Senate hearing Thursday, has repeatedly denied any allegation of wrongdoing, calling the allegations against himself “smears, pure and simple” in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley on Monday.BuzzFeed News reached out to dozens of Kavanaugh’s former Yale classmates, fraternity brothers, and society members, many of whom did not return requests for comment. Most of his closest friends, pursued by countless reporters across the country, had phones that were not accepting calls or voicemail boxes that were full.One college friend of Kavanaugh’s, who asked not to be named, said she had frequently been drunk with him at parties. She hadn’t seen him become belligerent, she said — instead, he could often be found slumped over, asleep, during and after parties.“He drank a lot — he wasn’t falling asleep reading a book,” the former friend told BuzzFeed News. “I would suggest that very few people in the ’80s in the circles we were in did not sometimes go” to the point of being blacked out.James Roche, Kavanaugh’s freshman year roommate, released a statement Tuesday that said Kavanaugh was a “notably heavy drinker” who often became “incoherently” drunk and, at times, “aggressive and belligerent.”Chris Dudley — a close friend of Kavanaugh's from Yale, and a former NBA player and Republican gubernatorial nominee in Oregon — strongly disputed that characterization to BuzzFeed News. ""When he went out Friday nights, I was usually with him,"" Dudley said of Kavanaugh. ""I never, ever saw him blacked out, never... Brett would drink, but he'd also be the guy who never missed a class. There's a reason he was top of his class.""S. Christopher Winter, who said he lived in a suite with Kavanaugh their freshman year in Yale’s Lawrance Hall, remembered Kavanaugh running “in a very drinky crowd.”“I was an out gay kid, and Brett was a conservative frat boy,” Winter said. “We did not socialize.”In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, many of his Yale classmates said a churning rumor mill had left them racking their brains for memories of his time there. But most described him as largely unremarkable: a sometimes-shy “frat boy” who, for many who spent time with him, left little lasting impression.“I could name 50 people who lived” in Kavanaugh’s freshman year dorm, said Jim O’Donnell, one of Kavanaugh’s classmates. “He’s not one of them that comes to mind.”Kavanaugh was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, a campus fraternity that many associated with debauchery and heavy drinking. A 1985 photograph in the Yale Daily News, taken during Kavanaugh’s time, showed a group of DKE pledges waving a flag they had made of women’s underwear as they paraded around campus.As a senior, Kavanaugh joined Truth and Courage, an informal “secret society” that stood in sharp contrast to the imposing traditions of Yale societies like Skull and Bones. Three former members told BuzzFeed News this summer that the group was mostly organized around fraternity life and drinking, meeting in members’ houses and fraternity basements to cook and, as many Yale societies do, to tell each other their life stories.“It was nothing like Scroll and Key, nothing like Wolf’s Head,” said one woman who graduated a year after Kavanaugh and said she knew members of Truth and Courage. “They just drank a ton. They got drunk.” She paused. “All I remember is them drinking.”To Fox News on Monday, Kavanaugh painted a picture of himself as a mostly straightlaced student, particularly in high school, despite occasionally attending parties where he said “people might have had too many beers on occasion.”In high school, he said, “I was focused on academics and athletics, going to church every Sunday at Little Flower, working on my service projects, and friendship, friendship with my fellow classmates and friendship with girls from the local all-girls Catholic schools.”But a New York Times article Monday night also chafed against that characterization, digging up a high school yearbook entry where Kavanaugh declared himself a “Renate Alumnius” — a reference to a girl at a neighboring school, Renate Schroeder, who appeared 14 times in the yearbook’s pages.Kavanaugh’s lawyer said the reference was to a high school event he had attended with Schroeder, “and nothing else.”The woman, who had been among 65 women from neighboring schools who signed a letter in support of Kavanaugh, told the Times that the “insinuation” in the yearbook entry “is horrible, hurtful and simply untrue.”The yearbook also appeared to reference drinking, listing Kavanaugh as the treasurer of the “Keg City Club.”On Fox Monday night, Kavanaugh said he remained a virgin throughout high school and “many years after” — something that another Yale classmate quickly and publicly disputed.Stephen Kantrowitz, who had lived in Kavanaugh’s dormitory as a freshman, tweeted Tuesday morning: “Perhaps Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin for many years after high school. But he claimed otherwise in a conversation with me during our freshman year in Lawrance Hall at Yale, in the living room of my suite.”In a follow-up statement to BuzzFeed News, he said he had brought up the conversation he had with Kavanaugh because he believes it “raises doubt” about what Kavanaugh had said on Fox. He remembered the conversation, he said, “because it was the first time I had had such a conversation with an acquaintance who was not a friend.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/21/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/brett-kavanaughs-yale-classmates-remember-him-in--2-7848-1537923878-1_dblbig.jpg4baaa2f19e1e46e5b385cc6631b097a1	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Texas Just Said In Court That A Black Girl Had To Stand For The Pledge Of Allegiance	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Texas Just Said In Court That A Black Girl Had To Stand For The Pledge Of Allegiance	0	"The state of Texas inserted itself into a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday to help argue that a black high school student was required to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, once again kicking the political football of flag protests into play weeks before the fall election.NFL players who have taken a knee during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination loom large over the case, which began when India Landry sued the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District last fall after school officials threatened to expel her for remaining seated during the Pledge of Allegiance.Landry — then 17, now 18 — was attending Windfern High School in Houston last fall, where she had abstained from the Pledge of Allegiance more than 200 times without a problem, she said in a complaint filed in federal court. But on Oct. 2, 2017, she was in Principal Martha Strother’s office when she refused to stand during the pledge. “Principal Strother upon seeing this immediately expelled India from school saying ‘Well you’re kicked outta here,’” the complaint continues, adding that a school secretary then added, “This is not the NFL.”On Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican up for reelection in November, filed a brief in US District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of the state, asking a federal judge for permission to argue against the student in order to defend a state law that mandates parental permission for students who sit out the pledge.“Requiring the pledge to be recited at the start of every school day has the laudable result of fostering respect for our flag and a patriotic love of our country,” Paxton said in a statement. “This case is about providing for the saying of the pledge of allegiance while respecting the parental right to direct the education of children.”But the student’s lawyer, Randall Kallinen, told BuzzFeed News that he believes Paxton’s moves are political.“It’s election time,” said Kallinen, adding that, while the state can defend its laws by joining lawsuits, the press announcement was designed to get votes. “This is to further their Republican values.”Kallinen pointed out that Landry’s mother, Kizzy Landry, supported her daughter’s choice to stay seated. But, he said, President Donald Trump chastising NFL players has inflamed conservatives. “Trump condemns the people kneeling for the national anthem, and he said we should kick the bums out,” Kallinen said. “When he said those words, he emboldened people within the school district to punish kids who sit during the Pledge of Allegiance.”Asked why she sat out the pledge, Kallinen cited Landry’s comment to local news stations and added, “Generally the same things, in many ways, as the people who kneel at the national anthem during NFL games.”Conservatives have seized on the debate over kneeling during the anthem as the midterm elections approach, including in Texas, where the protests have been seen as a convenient wedge issue for Republican candidates.Landry told KHOU shortly after the incident, “I don’t think that the flag is what it says it’s for, for liberty and justice and all that. It’s not obviously what’s going on in America today … I wouldn’t stand because it goes against everything I believe in.”“They were making rude comments saying ‘This isn’t the NFL, you won’t do this here,’” she said of school officials.On Oct. 5, Landry and her mother, Kizzy Landry, attended a meeting with the principal, who said India must stand for the pledge to be let back in at Windfern High School. “Principal Strother said that sitting was disrespectful and would not be allowed,” according to the complaint. “Principal Strother suggested that India write about justice and African Americans being killed. Ms. Strother then said the meeting is over and if India does not stand for the Pledge she cannot return to Windfern.”A cascade of lawsuits over the Pledge of Allegiance has risen through US courts for decades, most notably West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, in which the Supreme Court held a student could sit out the pledge in protest. However, the issue in Texas and some other states is more nuanced. In Florida, which also has a law that requires parental permission for students to opt out of the pledge, a lower court judge ruled in a student’s favor. But later, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a mixed ruling, largely reversing the lower court. It found that a student could skip the pledge, but it ruled the parental permission law was not unconstitutional on its face.As Paxton pointed out in the Texas brief Tuesday, the Texas Legislature enacted Texas Education Code Section 25.082(b), which states, “[t]he board of trustees of each school district ... shall require students, once during each school day at each campus, to recite ... the pledge of allegiance to the United States flag in accordance with 4 U.S.C. § 4.”“Texans also recognize that a critical aspect of the liberty guaranteed by the United States Constitution — and represented by the United States flag — is a parent’s right to direct the education and upbringing of his or her children,” the Texas brief said. “A State may act to protect that interest, and the Texas Legislature did so by giving the choice of whether an individual student will recite the Pledge to the student’s parent or guardian.”But Kallinen contends the state has no legitimate interest in whether students sit or stand for the pledge, and he notes that the court ruling in Barnette protected a student’s right to abstain from the pledge. “I say let’s go to the Supreme Court and ask them.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-29156-1537910859-7.jpg?crop=1347:705;64,9779a728541f54d40ace59785f3917465	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The Secretary Of Homeland Security Said There Was “No Policy Of Separating Families.” A Memo Proves There Was.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The Secretary Of Homeland Security Said There Was “No Policy Of Separating Families.” A Memo Proves There Was.	0	"Kirstjen Nielsen maintained that the administration did not enact a family separation policy, but a memo she signed stated that the “zero tolerance” policy would have that effect.Carlos Barria / ReutersA memo signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen contradicts statements she made at the height of the family separation crisis last spring that the administration did not have a policy of separating children from parents. Nielsen signed off on the option to prosecute all adults who crossed the border illegally, including those with kids, knowing it would lead to family separations. The administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which sought to prosecute every adult caught crossing the border illegally, resulted in thousands of families being separated, with some parents being deported without their children. “DHS could also permissibly direct the separation of parents or legal guardians and minors held in immigration detention so that the parent or legal guardian can be prosecuted,” the memo said. When the administration was under fire for the family separations Nielsen told reporters “This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border.” Yet, the memo she signed states the effect of attempting to prosecute every adult at the border would result in children being separated from their parents.We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.The memo was reported on by the Washington Post in April, but this is the first time the document has been made public. It was obtained by Open the Government and the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) through a Freedom of Information Act request. Katherine Hawkins, an investigator at POGO, said in a statement that the redacted documents are a small part of what must be an extensive paper trail on family separation. She called for the release of more documents “so that the officials responsible can be held to account.” The memo was sent by Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan, Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services L. Francis Cissna, and Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan. It’s stamped with an April 23 date.Loren Elliott / Reuters An undocumented immigrant father from El Salvador and his 3-year-old daughter are released from detention with other families at a bus depot in McAllen, Texas.The document also says that illegal immigration at the US–Mexico border is on the rise. Noting that immigrant families detained at the border or deemed inadmissible at ports of entry, like asylum-seekers, averaged 450 per day over the previous 21 days. The immigration officials also said that family units encountered between April 18 and 19 reached the highest level since 2016 at almost 700 per day. The number of immigrants at the borders this year is higher than 2017’s but that year was an outlier. The numbers are coming off historically low numbers of apprehensions in 2017, and in fact are consistent with the number of people detained trying to cross the US–Mexico border in recent years that started dropping, for the most part, during the administration of President George W. Bush. This year’s apprehension numbers for March, April, and May are on par with figures for those same months in 2013, 2014, and 2016, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.Read the memo here: Open the Government, Project on Government Oversight / Via assets.documentcloud.org"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-27391-1537909522-7.jpg?crop=1360:712;0,195069c64abe85b4fd0bd76bfa7449fe872	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The US And Europe’s Fight Over Iran Is Playing Out At The UN	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The US And Europe’s Fight Over Iran Is Playing Out At The UN	0	"UNITED NATIONS — A week of high-level meetings, speeches, and breakaway sessions at the United Nations is set to be the backdrop for Americans and Europeans alike digging in their respective heels on the Iran nuclear deal.President Donald Trump centered his address to the General Assembly on sovereignty — specifically, on the idea that anyone who tried to dictate US policy through multilateral institutions or multinational agreements was a threat. And he tried to paint the Iranian leadership, which Trump has attempted to pressure since pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal this past spring, as a threat to the sovereignty of nations in the Middle East and around the world.“Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death, and destruction. They do not respect their neighbors or borders, or the sovereign rights of nations,” he said. “Instead, Iran’s leaders plunder the nation’s resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond.”Since leaving the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the US has reimposed sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the deal and threatened new ones.But French President Emmanuel Macron, in his speech just a few hours later and subsequent remarks to the press, held the US approach up to a mirror: It was the United States, and not the Iranians, who were threatening sovereignty, both by trying to hurt Iran’s economy and by threatening to sanction those European companies that continued to do business with Iran.“What will bring a real solution to the situation in Iran and what has already stabilized it? The law of the strongest? Pressure from only one side? No!” Macron said in his address.Macron elaborated on the theme when speaking with reporters, saying that — despite Trump’s call for Europeans to get more of their energy supply from the United States — Macron would demand “real sovereignty, French and European sovereignty,” where energy was concerned. Asked about the consequences of the American approach to Iran on French companies, Macron said that he has little doubt the Trump administration will reimpose sanctions on the fourth of November — the date by which the administration has said it wants countries to have crude oil imports from Iran down to zero. And he knows that France and Europe cannot keep the largest and most international (and exposed) companies from leaving Iran.But, he added, he believes France, working with Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China, India, Russia, and regional partners, has constructed a “viable trade solution.”Macron was likely referring to a special payments channel announced by the European Union’s foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, the evening before. The new mechanism would legally allow trade and financial transactions with Iran to continue, skirting Washington’s reach and sanctions. The “unilateral US decision” had such an impact on European business that Macron considers it an act of “extraterritoriality,“ he said.The United States, however, could expand its sanctions to target the mechanism. Whether or not it will do so is as yet unclear, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized Europe for the plan on Tuesday. Speaking at the aptly titled United Against Nuclear Iran summit in New York, the US’s top diplomat called the plan “one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional global peace and security” and said the plan supports the sponsoring of terrorism.The question of just who is allowed to protect their own sovereignty is likely to continue throughout the week, including at Wednesday’s Security Council meeting on nonproliferation, which Trump will chair. Some have speculated that the subject — a pared-down topic compared to Iran, the original matter under discussion — could lead to a further rupture in US–European relations, with Europeans on the council contradicting and isolating the United States. One diplomat from a country seated on the council told BuzzFeed News that they were not walking in preparing for a confrontation, but to discuss nonproliferation. Still, the diplomat acknowledged, Trump had tweeted he’d be chairing a meeting on Iran, even after the reversal.For his part, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani used his speech to call attacking multilateralism “a symptom of the weakness of the intellect.” He also criticized those leaders who have “xenophobic tendencies resembling a Nazi disposition.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-6454-1537910816-6.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,2302d39cf933b3545b8b3e1fad99ce95e62	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		"Bill Cosby's Spokesperson: ""They Persecuted Jesus.

He added that Cosby was ""one of the greatest"" civil rights leaders and educators of the last 50 years. ""This was not pointed out to the jury or allowed in court because the racist and sexist mass media was attacking and denouncing Dr. Cosby whenever his lawyers even hinted there was racism and sexism present,"" Wyatt said.

Current and former US officials say a new campaign often described as “maximum pressure” has been informed by the strategy of Ronald Reagan, the conservative hero who is credited by some for paving the way for the demise of the Soviet Union. Proponents of this view who advocate a similarly aggressive approach toward Iran say that Reagan’s combative policy toward the Soviet regime amplified the problems caused by its corruption and mismanagement and pushed it over the edge to collapse. One window into that mindset is the circulation within the administration of an out-of-print book published in 1994 called Victory: The Reagan Administration’s Secret Strategy that Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union. The book was written by Peter Schweizer, a favorite author of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon whose more recent work, the book Clinton Cash and the movie of the same name, roiled the 2016 election with allegations about the Clinton Foundation and its foreign backers. In Victory, Schweizer chronicled the efforts of Reagan and his CIA director William Casey to deploy every tool of US power short of direct military confrontation to condemn the Soviet Union to the “ash heap of history,” as Reagan outlined in a 1982 speech to the British parliament. The strategy laid out by Schweizer includes economic warfare, which the US is waging against Iran in the form of an aggressive sanctions campaign. Several chapters focus on the more secretive aspects of that effort, from supporting dissident movements in Europe to funneling cash and weapons to Afghanistan’s mujahideen, who were fighting Soviet invaders. An official at the White House said it was “no secret” that the book has had some influence on policy. One prominent booster of the book is Mark Dubowitz, the head of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington think tank with perhaps the most outside influence on the Trump administration’s Iran policy. Critics blame Dubowitz’s years-long opposition to the landmark nuclear deal the Obama administration struck with Iran in 2015 for Trump’s decision to pull out of the accord in May. (Dubowitz argues that he wanted to fix the deal, not scrap it.) They also see him as an architect of the new US sanctions. “If you want to know what’s going to happen next in Iran policy, there’s a pretty good bet that it’s whatever has been in the latest Mark Dubowitz or FDD op-ed,” said a former US official who worked on Iran policy under Trump. Dubowitz has been touting Victory for more than two years and handing out copies, which he purchases used through third-party sellers on Amazon. Dubowitz, 50, said he viewed Victory as a blueprint. “It’s a fascinating book. There are a lot of specifics,” he said. “Many of the same ideas would be applicable against the Iranian regime.” The campaign of maximum pressure has taken shape quickly in the wake of Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. The onset of new sanctions has pushed an already weakened Iranian currency into a tailspin, and the most punishing sanctions, on Iran’s oil and energy industries, will begin in November. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has brought a muscular new diplomacy to the State Department since arriving there in April, promising to bring the “swagger” back to Foggy Bottom as he promotes a harder line on Iran than his predecessor, while national security adviser John Bolton, who had called publicly for regime change in Iran, took office the same month. All the while, countrywide demonstrations that have been ongoing in Iran since December are presenting its leaders with their most serious challenge since 2009, when hundreds of thousands of Iranians poured into the streets following a disputed election result and were brutally suppressed. The protests have received only passing attention in US media, overshadowed by the scandals and political warfare that grip the country, but US officials have been paying close attention, seeing an opportunity to further undermine the Iranian regime. “The people are paupers while the mullahs live like gods!” Brian Hook, who was tapped by Pompeo to lead a new Iran task force at the State Department, said from the podium at an FDD forum after his appointment last month, channeling the chants of the demonstrators.“This is a situation that is honestly ripe for, you know, exploitation.”Sources involved in the field of democracy promotion — in which the US government backs programs that support human rights and civil society in authoritarian countries — said that US officials have expressed interest in using these programs more aggressively to challenge the Iranian regime. “The idea is you put some pressure on the government, and it also helps in the future if and when this regime falls,” said a former national security official who’s under contract to work on a project targeting sanctions evasion and corruption in Iran. “I think it’s generally good stuff. More accountability within the Iranian regime can only be a good thing.” But he added: “This is a situation that is honestly ripe for, you know, exploitation.” US officials, including Bolton, have insisted publicly that their goal is not regime change, but to push Iran to change behavior beyond just its nuclear program, including the detention of US citizens and support for proxy groups such as Hezbollah. They say it’s up to Iran to decide where the campaign of maximum pressure leads. “The sanctions deny the regime the revenues it needs to fund terrorism and all the other destabilizing activities Iran undertakes,” Hook said in an interview. “We are compelling Iran to make a choice between ending these activities or facing greater economic pressure and isolation. And that’s only a choice the regime can make.”Getty ImagesYet even some who have helped to craft the hardline approach express concern about the potential consequences. “You’re putting a lot of pressure on the regime. So I think it’s only responsible to think through the implications of that pressure,” said a former senior official in the Trump administration who remains supportive of the approach but like others requested anonymity to speak candidly. “The biggest problem with that aspect of the strategy is you better have some sense of what you do after a collapse. You can’t just let it fall, or you’re going to have another Libya.” The former official said these are questions the Trump administration is grappling with behind the scenes. “The people working on the Middle East portfolio are not naive. They understand what vacuums of power do in the region. I mean, they’re never good.”“You better have some sense of what you do after a collapse. You can’t just let it fall, or you’re going to have another Libya.”Trump made his opposition to Obama’s accord with Iran a central feature of his election campaign, calling it “the worst deal ever.” It offered Iran relief from punishing international sanctions in exchange for rollbacks on its nuclear program, which US officials have long worried is designed to create a bomb. Proponents of the deal argue that it encouraged Iran to normalize its behavior and staved off conflict — and allowed Iran’s opponents the space to address its other forms of aggression while easing the nuclear threat. Critics said the nuclear concessions weren’t tough enough, and that the deal only provided a regime that has called for the destruction of Israel and America with the financial resources to shore up its security forces and fund its allies in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. As international corporations pull out of Iran and new sanctions undermine its battered economy, Trump has mused about the possibility of the regime’s collapse. “When I came into here, it was a question of when they would take over the Middle East,” he said in a recent interview. “Now it’s a question of will they survive.” Current and former officials acknowledge that Trump could also change direction unexpectedly — as he did on North Korea, embracing talks with its dictator after months of confrontational rhetoric. Several sources who have worked on Iran policy under Trump said the self-styled dealmaker would welcome the chance to strike his own accord with Iran, one that addressed the criticisms leveled at its predecessor. He will have the chance to signal his intentions on Iran on Wednesday, when he appears at the United Nations General Assembly in New York to chair a Security Council meeting on nuclear proliferation. The assembly will also serve as a reminder that despite the US’s withdrawal, the Iran deal is still in place. Its other key signatories — Britain, France, Germany, and the European Union, along with Russia and China — remain committed to the deal, while the UN has said that Iran has so far met its terms, leaving the US to push for cooperation on its new sanctions. A senior official in the Trump administration said the sanctions are working well so far. “November is coming and the second round of sanctions being reimposed will be even more powerful,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government policy. “We have seen a material shift in behavior, and we’re already seeing significant reductions in oil purchases from Iran, which is precisely what we want to see.” Richard Johnson, who was one of the State Department’s top experts on nuclear issues before he resigned over Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran deal, said he sees competing impulses in the administration: on the one hand, to change Iranian behavior and secure a better deal, and on the other, to use the opportunity of Trump’s presidency to engineer the regime’s downfall. For the moment, he said, both can be incorporated into the push for maximum pressure. “I really think that the folks driving this policy are true believers,” he said. “They truly believe that they can reinstitute a campaign of maximum pressure against Iran — that they can collapse Iran’s economy and bring it into recession and essentially bring the Iranians to their knees, to the point where they’re either coming to us and begging for talks, or where we’re essentially leading to regime collapse and something follows on.”“I really think that the folks driving this policy are true believers. They truly believe that they can ... collapse Iran’s economy and bring it into recession and essentially bring the Iranians to their knees.”Johnson, who worked extensively on both Iran and North Korea while in government and is now a senior director at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a US nonprofit, sees Iran as the greater immediate threat for conflict with the US, despite the fact that North Korea already has nuclear weapons. “In terms of where I think hostilities are more likely to break out, I’m more concerned about Iran,” he said. “Because for whatever reason on North Korea, the president has decided to play nice.” He added: “And the other thing that gets lost in the contrast with North Korea is that there’s no anti-North Korea lobby in Washington. And there is no parallel with regional states. You don’t have an Israel, you don’t have a Saudi Arabia, you don’t have a United Arab Emirates. There are so many other players on the Iran case that are driving this toward a potentially negative outcome.” Despite Trump’s aggressive rhetoric on Iran, he has been clear that, like most Americans, he doesn’t want another costly intervention in the Middle East. Yet Trump did launch targeted missile strikes against the Syrian government after a chemical weapons attack last year, and Eric Brewer, a US intelligence veteran who was director of counterproliferation on Trump’s National Security Council (NSC) until May, said that rising tensions between Washington and Iran have increased the chances for escalation. He worried about whether the administration had adequately thought through how it might respond to Iranian provocations such as a gradual resumption of some nuclear activities that were halted under the deal. “The only option they’ve articulated is ‘don’t, or else,’ which could be interpreted as threatening some type of military action, but isn’t clear,” he said. “Vague threats of military action to prevent Iran from adding a few centrifuges aren’t credible or wise.” He added: “There may be some who harbor this idea that a hardline approach could force Iran to overplay its hand, but I think that’s both unlikely and dangerous. I think we should be highly skeptical of anyone who claims they can confidently predict how this is all going to play out.”Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed NewsII “Of course, in public, they deny it,” Dubowitz, the FDD chief, said of the idea that the Trump administration’s policy on Iran is designed in part to destabilize and possibly collapse the regime. “I do think Bolton and others honestly believe that you can crack the regime the way Reagan cracked the Soviet Union.” He said that regime change is the wrong term because of its connection to the US war in Iraq: “In that context, it means a mechanized force invading Iran and a long-term US occupation. That’s not going to happen.” He added that leveraging a new deal could be one outcome of the Reagan-inspired strategy he espouses — and that the collapse of the Islamic regime could be another. Any scenario that followed such a collapse, he added, would be better than the present reality — reasoning that even if a hostile regime led by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards took control, it would be weakened by internal divisions and likely rule without the legitimacy of Iran’s clerical establishment. “Here is the Cold War parallel. The Soviet Union is today’s Russia. Russia is dangerous. I don’t want to minimize that danger. It’s just not the existential threat that the Soviet Union was,” he said. He did see one problem with the analogy. “Trump is not Reagan,” he said. “One must always keep that in mind.”Carolyn Kaster / AP Mark DubowitzIn Dubowitz’s view, it’s Pompeo, first as CIA director and now as secretary of state, who most ably channels the Reagan era. Dubowitz said that he handed Pompeo a copy of Victory after the former congressman from Kansas was named Trump’s first CIA director. According to Dubowitz, Pompeo read the book with interest and has shared it with colleagues at the CIA and State Department. “I asked him when he was at the CIA, ‘Director Pompeo, do you want to be Bill Casey?’” Dubowitz said, referring to Reagan’s CIA director. “I think he really put the agency on a much more aggressive footing with the Islamic republic.” As an example of Pompeo’s ability as a diplomat on Iran, Dubowitz cited a speech Pompeo gave at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in July. In the speech, called “Supporting Iranian Voices,” Pompeo declared America’s backing for the Iranian opposition and condemned the regime in sweeping terms. Dubowitz likened the speech to Reagan’s historic 1982 address at Westminster, in which Reagan condemned the Soviet Union to the “ash heap of history.” He also pointed out that Anthony Dolan, the speechwriter who penned that line, is now on the staff of the NSC. Pompeo did not respond to a request for comment. He has been a steadying figure in a turbulent administration, keeping Trump’s trust even as other officials have fallen out of favor. While at the CIA, he often delivered its daily briefings to the president personally. Like many conservatives, he adamantly opposed the nuclear deal on Capitol Hill, where a lack of support was one reason that Obama never asked Congress to ratify it as a treaty, signing it as an executive action instead. In a speech in May, Pompeo laid out 12 demands for changes in Iran’s behavior that covered, in addition to its nuclear program, topics such as ballistic missiles, support for proxy groups, assistance to rebels in Yemen, and the detention of US citizens. US officials cite these demands as the goal of their Iran policy. “Pompeo would do a deal,” Dubowitz said, if the right conditions were met. Yet a former senior US official who was involved with Iran policy called the demands unrealistic. “In a way, they’re cynically setting out these demands fully aware that they’re never going to be met — that it’s just politically impossible for the current government of Iran to concede all of these points,” he said. “By setting goals that are unrealizable, that will make a clearer path to impose even harsher sanctions as a penalty for not complying with those 12 demands. And that economic pressure will bring about the end of the Islamic republic and its replacement with something more benign.” The former official also worried that those seen as moderating influences on Iran policy — such as Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis — could see their voices weakened under a more aggressive US approach. The same scenario could play out in Iran as well. “In fact we’re strengthening the hands of people in Iran who advocate for a more confrontational approach, who would advocate for a greater willingness to use force against us,” the former official said. “And then of course once we get into that kind of downward spiral of threats and counter-threats, we have the same kind of dynamic going on here in Washington. It’s quite obvious that people who raise doubts about the wisdom of this policy are pretty much intimidated into staying silent about it. So thank goodness Mattis isn’t cowed by that. I think he’ll be arguing always for a more moderate response whenever possible. But his voice is increasingly lonely.” Bolton’s approach to running the NSC makes his voice especially influential. While his predecessor, H.R. McMaster, emphasized interagency deliberations on key policy questions like Iran, Bolton considers himself less bureaucratic manager than Trump’s top adviser on foreign policy. “For complex issues like Iran, we need the NSC policymaking process to run well,” said Brewer, the former NSC official. “The process works best when the options going to the president are reflective of interagency deliberations rather than the recommendations of a single individual.” One former US official who was involved in Iran policy under Trump said that those in the government who believe in a more moderate approach “have been operating in a culture of fear. And that has been the case since Day One — to the extent that people were very unwilling to talk on the phone with other colleagues in the government about certain things,” the official said. “Even on secure lines, we almost used to joke about it sometimes. It was like, ‘Oh, hello, whoever’s listening.’ Do I actually think that people were? I don’t know. Probably not. But there was a lot of concern.”“If you’re using all elements of American power, have you thought through what happens when you do?”This person added: “It really was just paranoia that was starting to set in, and we would have to have in-person meetings or meet for coffee, amongst our colleagues.” Despite the chaos in the Trump administration, US officials have set about pushing through a series of longstanding conservative priorities, such as tax cuts and the appointment of Supreme Court justices. Roger Noriega, a former US ambassador and assistant secretary of state who is now a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), said the same approach is taking shape in foreign policy. Noriega, who knows Bolton and Pompeo, said he’s a fan of Victory — he has an autographed copy and has shared the book with US policymakers — and believes it holds lessons for his own area of expertise, Latin America. He said that Pompeo, Bolton, and other members of Trump’s foreign policy team can operate despite the problems surrounding Trump. “While a lot of people who have joined the administration weren’t Trump stalwarts, we know that they’re serious people who are not going to be reined in by the president saying, ‘Hey, let me think about it, because I have to send some tweets,’” he said. “So I think it’s becoming a free-fire zone where they can try to take care of some of these [international] threats.” Even within the FDD, though, there is some lingering concern. Jonathan Schanzer, the FDD’s senior vice president for research, summed up the administration’s policy this way: “Hammer them with everything, and potentially even collapse the regime.” “The question I have about this book,” he said, tapping a copy of Victory, “is does the US have the chops to pull this off?” He added, “If you’re using all elements of American power, have you thought through what happens when you do?”Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed NewsIII During a recent visit to Washington, Schweizer, the author of Victory, who lives in Florida, said he was surprised to hear that his old book had received so much attention on the subject of Iran. While he has paid only casual attention to the debate over Iran policy in Washington, he said, he did notice some echoes of the Reagan era. As Reagan and his foreign policy team developed their own policy of maximum pressure, he noted, they couldn’t say for sure where it would lead. “This isn’t a science. It’s not like you can adjust the thermostat to the temperature you want,” he said. “If you say this is a strategy of maximum pressure, you just apply that pressure as much as you can and see what happens.”Gage Skidmore / flickr Peter SchweizerIn a recent article in Commentary, the scholar Frederick Kagan wrote a lengthy analysis of what he termed the “Victory Strategy” on Iran. The appeal, he wrote, “is obvious … the strategy produced the most desirable possible end of the Cold War — victory for the United States and its allies without a major direct conflict with the Soviet Union.” Kagan, a resident at AEI, where Bolton is a former senior fellow, wrote that elements of such a strategy could be successful in Iran if applied correctly and patiently. But within Kagan’s analysis are somber warnings: Such a strategy, Kagan wrote, would need to be gradual and would likely take years to accomplish, possibly stretching beyond a Trump presidency. It could also require the US to look on as the Iranian regime cracked down on the opposition with ferocious violence. During the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev first opened the door for democracy movements by allowing space for reform. Then, when pushed to the brink, he ultimately decided to step down rather than order the massacre of his opponents. In Iran, on the other hand, “It is almost impossible to imagine the current regime leadership losing the will to kill.” US programs to support Iranian civil society and opposition groups were ongoing even under Obama, including efforts to help Iranians keep unfettered access to the internet through tools such as virtual private networks and encryption technology. These programs have become more concerted against the regime under Trump, said Mariam Memarsadeghi, an Iranian American who runs Tavaana, a State Department–funded program to promote civil society in Iran. She said that the Trump administration is more in tune with groups like hers that oppose the regime — and that concerns of what might happen if the regime were to collapse are misplaced. “I think Iran right now more than at any time since the revolution has the absorptive capacity to take whatever resources, rhetoric, and support the US can provide, and the US would be foolish not to take the opportunity,” she said. “Are there causes for concern? Yes, there are. But I’m sure that other countries that have made the transition from autocracy have had concerns as well.”US programs to support Iranian civil society and opposition groups were ongoing under Obama. They've become more concerted under Trump.Another source involved with US-backed democracy programs in Iran had found recent conversations with US officials alarming: “They’ve been reaching out to see how you can weaponize [the programs].” Asked how, this person responded: “In theory? Create upheaval.” The source noted that there are ways the US government could seek to exploit democracy promotion programs: helping to fund and organize demonstrations and boycotts, for example, or running social media campaigns intended to promote regime change. “They’re trying to find something. They’re searching for things that you can do in the country,” this person said. The former national security official involved in the corruption and sanctions project cautioned against the idea that any US government “can turn back the clock 50 years in six months.” “It can backfire on you,” he said. “Or it contributes to mission creep.” A retired senior intelligence official cautioned against misreading the likely impact of the protests, which he called a “rudderless” and “leaderless” movement that “just doesn’t threaten the regime.” He added, “Anyone who believes that the Iranian regime is about to collapse is ignoring the data.”Getty Images Left: Trump shows the document signed to reinstate sanctions against Iran, May 8, 2018. Right: Protests of the sanctions in Tehran, May 9, 2018.He called sanctions “by their very nature, a long-term policy” and believed the Cold War frame could apply to Iran if policymakers are willing to be patient. Having worked with Pompeo during his time as CIA director, he said that while Pompeo espouses a tougher stance on Iran, he also takes the long view. “In many ways, the way to handle Iran benefits from using the approach we employed against the Soviets: Engage when possible, confront when we must,” he said. “I think there is a connection between then and now. But at the same time that’s long-term. And from what I know about Pompeo, he’s thinking long-term. His goal at the agency was to make the organization more responsive and robust, and he shows every sign of doing the same at State.”Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed NewsIV Yet the push for faster and more aggressive action on Iran continues. Reuel Marc Gerecht, who worked on Iranian operations for the CIA in the 1980s and 1990s and is now a senior fellow at the FDD, promotes an even harder line than Dubowitz on Iran. (“Reuel thinks I’m a total wimp,” Dubowitz said.) Gerecht and a co-author recently published an essay in the Weekly Standard calling on Trump and his foreign policy team to aggressively pursue a regime change strategy in Iran. “The White House has all the elements of a regime change strategy despite its denials,” the authors wrote. “Post-Iraq, post-Afghanistan, the primary American question is whether Washington’s political elite is capable of imagining interventionism. A successful regime-change approach isn’t likely if one doesn’t really believe, as Reagan did, that American aid to those seeking freedom is both good and strategic.”“The primary American question is whether Washington’s political elite is capable of imagining interventionism.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/14/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/original-30630-1537898979-2.jpg?crop=1024:536;0,146fe1e53c07b2e4424b9aefc3e59d4f19d	['Buzzfeed Contributor']		I Was The US Treasurer.

I Didn't Tell The FBI Background Checkers About My Abuser.	0	"I don’t know Brett Kavanaugh personally, but all my friends who know him say he is a good man and he conducts himself honorably. I don’t know Professor Christine Blasey Ford, but from the people who do know her, I can infer that she is also a good woman who conducts herself honorably. Kavanaugh could have done what Ford has accused him of back when he was 17 and gone on to be a remarkable student, father, husband, and judge; those two behaviors are not mutually exclusive. So the question is, who is telling the truth regarding what happened on that day more than three decades ago?I believe her.I was a victim of sexual abuse. I was 5 years old. I may not remember what color dress I was wearing or how long my hair was, but the times, the locations, and most importantly how I felt are ineradicable. They live forever in my mind.It took 18 years before I shared those awful memories for the first time. It was to the man I was about to marry. It took another four years before I told my mother. I did not even mention it to the FBI when they interviewed me as part of an extensive background check I underwent to become the treasurer of the United States in 2001.It wasn’t until I was 49 years old, in 2007, that I went public with that horrific episode of my life. I wrote about it in my biography, meaning finally, after more than four decades, all my family and friends — along with the rest of the world — found out about it.Today I often give keynote speeches, and sometimes I talk about those awful experiences; each time is both excruciatingly painful and ugly. In every single conference where I have shared these memories, invariably at least one woman approaches me afterward and says, “It happened to me too.” Often they tell me that they have never shared this with anyone else. Some of these women are in their seventies and my heart shatters. I see their anguish, I cry with them, and I just wish I could take their pain away. But I know all too well that those emotions will be with them, as they are with me, for the rest of their lives.Professor Ford has absolutely no reason to make something like this up. This is not fun, and it’s not a pathway to a better life — just the opposite. This is so very hurtful. She has lived with those atrocious feelings all these years, and the trauma even affected her marriage. Why would she put herself on this torturous path unless what she says happened is true?But in a world where politics has infected every inch of our daily lives, it is not surprising that the polarization in our country would extend to something as straightforward as this. Those who support Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court have insulted Ford, attacked her integrity, questioned her motives, and threatened her and her family. Others have promoted ridiculous conspiracy theories or attempted to prove that Ford’s memories are wrong. Even as Kavanaugh has categorically denied Ford’s claims, some of his supporters have chosen instead to say that even if they are true — that is, even if he is lying — they are the kind of youthful indiscretions that shouldn’t matter when considering a Supreme Court nominee.If all goes to plan, Ford will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee later this week, as will Kavanaugh; Democrats and Republicans alike will be given the chance to ask important questions of each of them.Republicans, and especially male senators on the Judiciary Committee, should be extremely careful about how they treat Ford during the hearings and the days that follow. They should remember voters’ anger about the dismissive and disrespectful treatment of Anita Hill, and know that their behavior could have dire consequences at the polls come the midterm elections on Nov. 6.I strongly caution anyone who has not been a victim of sexual abuse, molestation, or harassment: Do not judge her. Just be grateful you have never been in her shoes."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-24078-1537907427-9.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230135bc70cb6574613a3783b7a02f1dd3e	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Padma Lakshmi Said She Was Raped At 16 And Didn’t Report It	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Padma Lakshmi Said She Was Raped At 16 And Didn’t Report It	0	"Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi said in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday that she was raped by her boyfriend as a teenager, and was compelled to break her silence on the issue after politicians wondered why two women accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct didn’t report it sooner.Lakshmi said she was inspired by Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez to come forward about what happened to her.

The meeting would address “a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms,” the department said in its initial announcement.Twitter “SHADOW BANNING” prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.But political bias received little attention at the meeting, which lasted a little over an hour at the Department of Justice in Washington on Tuesday. “The discussion centered on ways the Department and state governments can most effectively safeguard consumers using online digital platforms,” read a Justice Department summary of the meeting. “The discussion principally focused on consumer protection and data privacy issues, and the bipartisan group of attendees sought to identify areas of consensus.”Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, reviewing notes he took in the meeting, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions “talked specifically about political bias that the Justice Department is concerned about” in his remarks as well as social media companies’ economic power and their potential to violate users’ privacy. But while the state attorneys general in general agreed that economic power and privacy concerns were issues to pursue, “at least a few others strongly disagree that the government — the Justice Department — should be attempting to stifle political speech in any way whatsoever,” he said. “I don’t think the state Republican attorneys general think that’s an appropriate direction to go, but [Attorney] General Sessions did bring the conversation back to that several different times,” Frosh said. The 13 states represented — Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington, as well as Washington, DC — joined top Justice Department staff, including Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Josh Edelson / AFP / Getty Images California Attorney General Xavier Becerra"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/25/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/jeff-sessions-finally-met-with-state-officials-ab-2-22643-1537916180-0_dblbig.jpg0843735f17db4f85b0e4d9732466de15	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Judi Dench Says Kevin Spacey Shouldn't Be Cut From Old Films	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Judi Dench Says Kevin Spacey Shouldn't Be Cut From Old Films	0	"Judi Dench said Tuesday that Kevin Spacey remains a ""good friend"" of hers despite the actor being accused of sexual harassment or assault by some 15 men.Speaking at the San Sebastian International Film Festival in Spain, the British dame added that Spacey ""is, and was, a most wonderful actor"" and shouldn't be edited out of films.""I can’t approve, in any way, of the fact that — whatever he has done — that you then start to cut him out of the films,"" she said, according to Variety.Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer in the 2017 film All the Money in the World, after BuzzFeed News first reported Spacey had made a sexual advance toward actor Anthony Rapp in the 1980s when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14.Those reshoots were done prior to the film's release in a bid to try to salvage the movie from Spacey's involvement, but Dench seemed to suggest she believed people were campaigning to have Spacey edited out from past films.“Are we to do what happened when he was replaced with Christopher Plummer?

Rubicon Project is committed to transparency, and we want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to individuals (like you), and the choices that are available to you.Please note:This privacy policy does not govern (i) the collection and use of data on our website ( http://www.rubiconproject.com ) – that information can be found here ; or (ii) our clients’ collection, use and disclosure of information through their Digital Media Properties (defined below), which is governed by their own privacy policies and practices. For these purposes, our clients include advertisers and publishers as described below under the heading “About Us.”About UsRubicon Project provides a digital advertising technology platform and related services that connects advertising buyers (advertisers) with sellers (publishers) of advertising inventory. For example, advertisers (or their agents) may use our technology to buy advertising for display on publishers’ websites, mobile applications and other digital media properties (which we collectively refer to as “Digital Media Properties”). We also provide related software and APIs for developers. You can find out more about this here.Information We CollectWhen you visit a Digital Media Property that uses our technology, we collect certain information about you and your device (“User Information“). Some of this information (including for example your IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device, and may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the European Union.Information that we collect includes:Information about your behavior on our publishers’ Digital Media Properties: including information about the domain, your referring website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search keywords, visitor activities and actions on publisher’s sites, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation (including city, country, zip code, and potentially geographic coordinates if you have enabled location services on your device), click data, types of advertisements viewed;including information about the domain, your referring website addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, search keywords, visitor activities and actions on publisher’s sites, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation (including city, country, zip code, and potentially geographic coordinates if you have enabled location services on your device), click data, types of advertisements viewed; Information about your browser: including information about your browser type and language, and browser history;including information about your browser type and language, and browser history; Information about your device: including information about your IP address, device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type; andincluding information about your IP address, device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type; and Information about your Internet service: including information about which Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use.We do not collect any “sensitive” or “special categories of personal data” as defined under European data protection laws.How We Collect User InformationWe use cookies and other standard web technologies to collect information automatically from your device. Please review our Platform Cookie Statement for further information.Other technologies: Additionally, we use other technologies, including local storage, to collect User Information in order to assist with the delivery of ads and to provide reporting to our customers.In addition, we also work with third party advertising platforms that separately collect and use User Information to enable our and their customers to deliver targeted advertisements using our advertising technology. As an example, we work with companies that use information about your visits to various websites or applications across multiple devices in order to provide you content and ads of interest across those devices. Our customers may use this third-party data in combination with your User Information to deliver you targeted ads across multiple devices.How We Use User InformationWe primarily use the User Information we collect to enable our clients to buy and sell advertising space on Digital Media Properties. In particular, our customers use information we provide, in conjunction with other information they have independently collected, to deliver end users targeted advertising they believe will be of particular interest to those users based on interests that might be inferred from the User Information that we collect. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work .We may also use the User Information we collect for our legitimate business interests:To operate and improve our technology;To compile statistics and conduct research and development for our internal business purposes – all of which is done in aggregate without identifying you;To enable standard advertising controls;To prepare reports that summarize visitor activity;To analyze and report on ad performance (such as tracking views of ad, as well as click-through rates on ads), campaign reporting, and campaign forecasting; andTo protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity.Legal basis for Processing User Information (EEA end users only)If you are an end user located in the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the User Information described above will depend on the User Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.However, we normally rely on our legitimate interests to collect User Information from you, except where such interests are overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your User Information, they include the interests described in the section headed “How We Use User Information“.In some cases, we may rely on our consent or have a legal obligation to collect User Information from you or may otherwise need the User Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your User Information, we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your User Information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.Information RetentionWe never store any data longer than we think we need it. The cookies set out on our device expire no later than 366 days after they were last accessed. We typically store the User Information we collect, such as IP address and other information described above, for up to 90 days before we anonymize and aggregate that data into summary reports. User Information we no longer need is deleted from either the cookies or our servers (as applicable).In some cases, we may keep some of the User Information for longer periods of time where required under certain laws or to comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests – for example, those relating to corporate governance, taxation, money laundering and financial reporting legislation.Sharing of User InformationWe share User Information that we collect as follows:Customer : We share User Information with our advertiser clients to help them identify and buy advertising on publishers’ Digital Media Properties. Clients may use this information in conjunction with other information they have independently collected to provide you targeted advertising and to help them evaluate whether a particular ad campaign may be of interest to you.: We share User Information with our advertiser clients to help them identify and buy advertising on publishers’ Digital Media Properties.

We are not responsible for our clients, vendors and/or our clients’ vendors use of such tracking technologies or for their privacy practices.Your Opt-Out ChoicesThere are many ways to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising that our clients may conduct using our technology. Note that different devices use different identifiers and different technologies, so that you must opt out separately from each browser and each device that you would like to be opted out. If you opt-out of targeted advertising, we will no longer collect User Information described above from your device.DisplayShould you wish to opt-out of the use of information about the websites you visit in order to deliver targeted advertising to you using our “display” technology, you can do so using the opt-out tool on our website, at http://rubiconproject.com/privacy/consumer-online-profile-and-opt-out/ .Additionally, you can opt-out by using any of the following three mechanisms. First, because we are a member of the NAI and adhere to the NAI’s code of conduct and mobile code of conduct, you can opt-out of targeted advertising by participating companies, including Rubicon Project, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ . Second, because we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles, you can visit the DAA’s opt-out page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ . Third, for users located in the European Union, Rubicon Project also adheres to the Interactive Advertising Bureau of Europe’s Online Behavioral Advertising Framework. Accordingly, EU-based users can opt-out of targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu .Please note that these opt-outs operate by placing a cookie on your device that is unique to the browser and device you use to opt-out. They may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies. If you change browsers or computers, or delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again. You also can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to block most cookies, including ours.MobileYour device may give you the ability to opt-out of the use of information about the apps you use in order to serve you ads that are targeted to your interests (“Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” on Android devices or “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS devices). You may stop the collection of location information by particular apps or from your device as a whole at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.European Data Subject RightsIf you are a resident of a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use of information about you. As stated above, the information that we collect about you when you visit Digital Media Properties that use our advertising technology may include certain digital identifiers that are considered “personal data” under European law.As a resident of a country in the EEA, you have the right to: (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your User Information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your User Information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your User Information.If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please see our Data Subject Rights policy for instructions on how to do so: http://rubiconproject.com/terms-conditions/subject-access-request-policy/ . Please note that because most of the information we store can only identify a particular browser or device, and cannot identify you individually, you need to provide us with some additional information to enable us to identify the User Information we hold about you, if any, and ensure that we accurately fulfill your request.In addition, you may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Rubicon Project. If you would like to exercise this right, please write to us at the contact details provided below.Finally, as a resident of the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of personal data with a European Data Protection Authority. For contact details of your relevant local Data Protection Authority, please see here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.SecurityWe use industry-standard technical and organizational security measures to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems. Please note that no transmission or storage of information, however, can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure, though we take all reasonable precautions to protect against security incidents.Changes to this PolicyWe may update this policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you of any material changes by posting the revised policy on this website, and where necessary, by any other means required by applicable law.Data Transfers for Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA)Rubicon Project is a global company headquartered in the United States with data centers located in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong. If you are accessing any of the Digital Media Properties from outside the United States, please be aware that your data may be transferred to, stored and processed by us and our affiliates in our facilities in the United States and other countries (including in Hong Kong, Brazil, Japan, Singapore and Australia, where our global affiliates have offices) and by those third parties with whom we may share your User Information.These countries (including the United States) may not provide a level of data protection for your User Information that would be considered adequate as determined by the European Commission, or have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however ensure that where Rubicon Project group companies or third party service providers receive User Information outside of the EEA, appropriate protections are in place under European data protection legislation.For example, in order to ensure that your User Information is adequately protected when transferred outside of the EEA, The Rubicon Project Ltd. has entered into inter-company “model clause” agreements and other adequacy arrangements with other various entities located outside the EEA that may process your User Information on behalf of The Rubicon Project Ltd.

I know, I know, repotting sounds daunting. But the small plastic pots that most succulents are sold in restrict their growth and dry too slowly — something succulents hate. Plus, sticking your hands in a little dirt is good for your mental health.Your succulent prefers its roots to dry out quickly, so it'll do better in a pot with good drainage and plenty of airflow. If it sits in wet soil for too long, its roots will rot and you'll be sad. That's why a terra cotta pot is a perfect fit: it's fast-drying, it's breathable, it absorbs water from the soil, and it keeps water from building up. Go for one that's one or two inches larger than your current pot.If you're committed to using a glass bowl or terrarium, make sure you buy some lava rocks to put at the bottom. Glass looks cool as heck, but it doesn't allow for drainage. The lava rocks will allow water to pool without drowning the roots, and they'll absorb any excess water too."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/12/15/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/original-32148-1536782279-12.png?crop=790:413;133,113918bae0a25294e2b9a2856457b2585e6	['Buzzfeed Staff']		Here's How Public Bathing Looks In Nine Countries Around The World	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Here's How Public Bathing Looks In Nine Countries Around The World	0	"Bathhouse, hamami, jjimjilbang, banya — no matter the term, the art of public bathing has been around for thousands of years across the globe.In some cultures, it represents the importance of taking time to rest and relax — in others it's seen as a chance to socialize and build community.

The District of Columbia attorney general, Karl Racine, will also attend. Twenty-four states had been invited.States haven’t received a formal itinerary in advance of the meeting, officials said.Top Justice officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Acting Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio, and Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim are scheduled to attend.The DOJ originally announced the meeting in the immediate aftermath of a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that quizzed Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about their policies. While that hearing never addressed whether the social media platforms discriminated against conservative viewpoints, it came after Apple, Google, and Facebook had banned right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who during a break berated Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, claiming that tech companies’ decision to ban him from their platforms was evidence those companies are “purging conservatives.”Prominent elected Republicans have stressed the idea in recent months that tech companies are biased against them, with little evidence.

But the literal administration of elections, like the printing of ballots, coordinating poll workers, and organizing polling places, falls to more than 10,000 county clerks and local municipalities, according to the nonprofit organization Verified Voting.And those are the people the Department of Homeland Security would like to sign up for its cybersecurity program.“There should not be any counties left out, because they can sign up for cyber hygiene scanning,” Jeanette Manfra, DHS’s top cybersecurity official, told BuzzFeed News.“They absolutely have the ability to be a partner. They might not know about it, so we’ve got to keep working to get the message out,” Manfra said.Counties in particular have been targeted by foreign government hackers. In 2016, Russian military intelligence sent phishing emails to VR Systems, a voting equipment manufacturer, and to county employees. Six weeks before the election, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security had to frantically alert Florida counties of an unspecified Russian threat.It’s not that free cybersecurity tools don’t exist. The Department of Homeland Security offers an election-specific version of its threat-sharing program, called EI-ISAC, to anyone who wants it, and has done a number of outreach events around the country in recent months to promote it. All 50 state governments have joined, but county and local governments participating only number about 1,100.Recently, several major tech companies have created free cybersecurity programs to help secure elections. Jigsaw, Google’s sister company, has Project Shield, which protects nonprofits and newsrooms from DDoS (or ""distributed denial-of-service"") attacks, and this year made it available to US political organizations. Jigsaw won’t say exactly how many US counties use the service, but their total number of protected sites around the world is fewer than 1,000. Cloudflare’s Athenian Project makes its full cybersecurity service free to US government sites. Around 60 local and county governments are in discussions to use it.“County governments are enterprises like any other business, and when they have services that are out on the web or connected to networks, they have to be protected like any other businesses,” said Verified Voting president Marian Schneider, who previously was an election security adviser to the state of Pennsylvania.The US’s decentralized election setup means that attitudes, resources, and priorities vary wildly among its smaller governments.“We’re playing catch-up. A lot of the technology and the programs available are complex if you’re not from a computer world,” said Barb Byrum, the clerk for Ingham County in Michigan.Byrum recently began using EI-ISAC, though she’s found its regular cybersecurity updates a little overwhelming.“I think the reason you’re not seeing clerks embrace the free or low-cost programs is not that we don't want to — it’s that there’s so much on our plate,” Byrum said. “We just got off an August election; now we’re jumping into a November election.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/21/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-7657-1537566125-9.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230c7881e1d17544eebae0a79eee2aceaba	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		24 States Have Been Invited To The Justice Department's Meeting On Whether Tech Companies Are Biased	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	24 States Have Been Invited To The Justice Department's Meeting On Whether Tech Companies Are Biased	0	"Attorneys general from nearly half the states have been invited to attend a Justice Department meeting later this month about allegations of political bias on social media platforms.Attorney General Jeff Sessions first announced the meeting, which will be held in Washington, DC, Sept. 25, on the heels of the banning of Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from platforms controlled by Apple, Facebook, and Twitter for making threats and violating those platforms’ terms of service.Jones threw a tantrum during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with tech companies on the day of the announcement. At the time, the Justice Department said only that “a number of states” had been invited to the meeting “to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.”On Thursday, the Justice Department said that 24 states had expressed an interest in attending, prompting the agency to send them formal invitations. It declined to provide the full list of the states invited, but the guest list includes both Republican and Democratic officials. Representatives from California, Louisiana, and Texas have confirmed to BuzzFeed News that they plan to attend. Nebraska and Washington state also received invitations.The meeting, the Justice Department said, will concern “tech companies, competition, and free exchange of ideas,” and is expected to address whether companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter have a monopoly and are biased against conservatives.In a statement, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, said he’d sought an invitation to the event and asked the Justice Department to include “states with interests involving the future and oversight of social media platforms be included in any discussion of this subject.”The idea of a series of state investigations into social media platforms worries some First Amendment advocates, and some experts say such probes would be the most legally effective strategy to attack those companies.President Trump called for an investigation in July, after reports that some conservatives briefly didn’t show up in Twitter’s search bar. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified before Congress that their absence was the temporary effect of an automated tool that made it harder to find users whose followers harassed other people.In August, Trump tweeted a doctored video that falsely claimed that Google search had removed a notification of his State of the Union address, then claimed “Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!” The first announcement of the planned meeting came eight days later.Joe Bernstein and Dominic Holden contributed reporting to this story."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/13/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-2365-1536881269-1.jpg?crop=1420:743;0,2034b2db6325a0b4dad93be6b5c81f2ea2c	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The Indictment Of North Korea For The Sony Hack Shows How Cybersecurity Has Evolved	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The Indictment Of North Korea For The Sony Hack Shows How Cybersecurity Has Evolved	0	"The charges this week against North Korea for the devastating hack of Sony Pictures four years ago didn’t just finally illuminate what happened, it also revealed just how much the public's reaction has changed when the US government accuses another country of a cyberattack.The Justice Department’s 179-page complaint, issued Thursday, carefully lays out the forensic analysis that led to the accusation that North Korean military intelligence was behind a series of high-profile hacks like those against Sony and the Bangladesh Bank, and the WannaCry ransomware worm that paralyzed tens of thousands of computers around the world.But when Sony was hacked in 2014, and the FBI blamed North Korea only a month later, a number of supposed experts not only publicly doubted the FBI’s evidence — it provided very little — but insisted its conclusion was wrong.“There was this narrative for a while that nobody knows you’re a dog on the internet, so how can anyone have any idea who someone could be?” said Ben Read, who at the time of the Sony hack worked at FireEye, the cybersecurity company that handled the Sony case and supported the FBI's conclusions. He's now FireEye's manager of espionage analysis, though he won't say if he was involved in the Sony case.Others involved in investigating the Sony attack said such criticism never shook their confidence in the original attribution of the attack to North Korea.“It was mildly annoying but we knew that the people making those assertions either had alternate motivations or did not know what they were talking about,” said a former intelligence official directly familiar with the Sony attack and who requested that they not be named to freely discuss a classified operation.“I know people said [otherwise] but the US government never makes public attribution unless it is high confidence and supported by all agencies,” the former official said.A number of purported experts publicly refuted the FBI’s claim at the time. Jeffrey Carr, who then ran a cybersecurity company called Taia Global and was widely cited by reporters, said that because then–FBI director James Comey referenced the hackers using a North Korean IP address, the FBI mistakenly jumped to the conclusion the government was responsible. “As of today, the U.S. government is in the uniquely embarrassing position of being tricked by a hacker crew into charging another foreign government with a crime it didn't commit,” he wrote.Another early critic of the FBI's conclusion was Kurt Stammberger, a senior vice president with cybersecurity firm Norse. He told CBS News then that his firm was “very confident that this was not an attack masterminded by North Korea."" Instead, he said, the most likely suspects were ""insiders"" who ""were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history."" Norse, which was not involved in analyzing the Sony hack, believed it had found a woman named Lena who was involved.Marc Rogers, who then was the director of security operations for the hacker conference DEF CON and the principal security researcher for the security company Cloudflare, wrote an analysis for the Daily Beast at the time that also suggested an insider was responsible. “Occam’s razor suggests the simpler explanation of a pissed-off insider,"" he wrote. ""Combine that with the details of several layoffs that Sony was planning and you don’t have to stretch the imagination too far to consider that a disgruntled Sony employee might be at the heart of it all,” he wrote.Carr, who didn’t immediately respond to questions from BuzzFeed News for this article, has since left the cybersecurity industry and works in cryptocurrency. Stammberger has also left cybersecurity, he told BuzzFeed News, and blamed the bad analysis on Norse, which later went out of business.“I was acting as a spokesman for my company, rather than that being my personal opinion,” he told BuzzFeed News. “I don’t have anything relevant or current to add, because I haven’t really worked in this space in the past 18 months. And as you know, cyber moves very quickly. I just don’t have any data for you.""Rogers, now the vice president of cybersecurity for Okta, the login management company, told BuzzFeed News that while he speaks less to reporters these days than he did around the time of the Sony hack, he stands by his assessment and remains unconvinced that North Korea was definitely behind the attacks. He calls the evidence “circumstantial.”“The thing I’ve said right at the start is attribution is hard. In fact, it’s probably one of hardest things in cybersecurity. All of the advantages lie with the attacker,” he said.“Our democracy is based on the right to due process. And it’s based on ... a certain amount of evidence, otherwise the other party is presumed to be innocent. I don’t see why cybersecurity is presumed to be any different,” Rogers said.But for analysts who work for cybersecurity companies that do publicly attribute and whose conclusions are often in line with the US government’s, it’s been frustrating to watch the idea take hold that their work is invalid — epitomized by President Trump's assertion that the hackers of the Democratic National Committee's computers ""could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,” a remark he made after the US intelligence community had concluded that Russian agents were behind the hack.“That was promulgated by a group of people who had no business even talking about it in the first place, the people who were like, 'Oh, attribution’s impossible,'” said Adam Meyers, vice president of Crowdstrike, the company that handled the DNC's incident response when it was hacked. “Attribution is definitely not impossible. It’s difficult, and you have to be measured in it, but the biggest challenge is people saying that wanted to get a picture of the person doing it on the computer.”Since the Sony hack, the industry has gotten better, in part because “the charlatans have been wrong again and again. Some are completely out of business,” said John Hultquist, FireEye’s director of intelligence.“I think there was some hesitation by experts to believe that (North Korea) would cross the Rubicon so to speak by hacking Sony,” said Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency officer who founded his own cybersecurity company, Rendition Infosec.The situation is different now, he said. “We have better data in the industry now than we did then. There's more data sharing and less data hoarding. We are definitely seeing a more complete picture today.”Meyers doubts, however, that that will prevent attribution claims from being challenged.""Look at the Kennedy assassination,"" he said. ""Almost 60 years later, people are still debating: Was it a single shooter? Was it the mafia? The Cubans? The Russians?"""	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/7/18/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/original-20936-1536360056-1.jpg?crop=3500:1832;0,501aa0584b7042843be8994bc7d352ced74	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The US Has Accused North Korea Of Hacking Sony Hours After Trump Tweeted “Thank You To Chairman Kim”	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The US Has Accused North Korea Of Hacking Sony Hours After Trump Tweeted “Thank You To Chairman Kim”	0	"The Department of Justice filed charges on Thursday accusing a North Korean spy of years of destructive hacking mere hours after President Trump praised North Korea's leader on Twitter.Kim Jong Un of North Korea proclaims “unwavering faith in President Trump.” Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!The announcement, which was packaged with one from the Treasury Department heralding further sanctions against North Korea, illustrates a disconnect between the Trump administration’s policy on the country and what the president himself says. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced he would be traveling to North Korea in a few days, only for Trump to cancel the trip the next day by tweet.The charges, which were sealed until Thursday, were filed on June 8, four days before Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a historic summit. Justice Department officials declined to share specifics on timing, and the White House didn’t immediately respond to a question of whether it had asked for the charges to be delayed. The Justice Department has had no communication with North Korea on the issue, an agency official said.The UK's National Crime Agency, which sometimes partners with the US to jointly attribute signifiant hacks to a foreign government, was informed of the charges before they were announced and issued its own statement praising them.“The collaboration between UK and US law enforcement has been strong and effective and these charges show that we will not tire in our efforts to identify those who believe they can hide behind a computer and cause havoc across the world, regardless of their motivation or status,” said NCA Director General Steve Rodhouse.The charges cover years of high-profile hacks believed to be the work of the North Korean government, including the 2014 hack of Sony Entertainment; the hack into the Bank of Bangladesh, which resulted in the theft of $101 million; and the WannaCry ransomware worm, which in 2017 shut down networks around the world, including more than a third of the organizations in the UK’s National Health Service.The US was confident that North Korea was behind the Sony hack, which occurred as the company planned to release a comedy about Kim's assassination, almost immediately after it happened. The FBI announced as much in December 2014.The US was aware of some of the Sony hackers' screen names and online personas by early 2015, a former US intelligence official familiar with the investigation into the hack told BuzzFeed News.The Justice Department declined to comment on why those charges were filed now, rather than earlier.Though the indictment refers to a large set of hacking conspiracies, it only charges a single individual, identified as Pak Jin Hek. A Justice Department official declined to say why the indictment didn’t name other individuals but noted the investigation is ongoing.Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department has ramped up the practice of charging hackers working on behalf of an adversarial government, a tactic that offers almost no chance that an alleged criminal will be extradited but functions as a way to “name and shame” hackers."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/6/15/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/the-us-has-accused-north-korea-of-hacking-sony-ho-2-30430-1536260585-6_dblbig.jpgbc838230938f4c60aa28b07c61d58bb3	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Alex Jones May Have Just Gotten A Federal Investigation Into His Banning	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Alex Jones May Have Just Gotten A Federal Investigation Into His Banning	0	"The Justice Department says it is investigating social media companies’ alleged political bias amid claims from President Trump and other conservatives that social media is unfair to them.Referring to Facebook and Twitter, the Justice Department on Wednesday announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions “has convened a meeting with a number of state attorneys general this month to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.”The move immediately prompted free speech concerns.“There has been no allegation that the social media companies have violated the law in handling the speech on their platforms, and thus no apparent reason for the DOJ to become involved. The DOJ’s intervention here appears to be an attack on free speech, not a defense of it,” said Alex Abdo, a senior staff attorney Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute.The Justice Department declined to elaborate on which laws the companies may have broken or how they were stifling an exchange of ideas. Several state attorneys general declined to say if they were attending the meeting, which sources said was scheduled for Sept. 25.Companies such as Facebook and Twitter are behemoths in social media, which exposes them to potential claims that they hold a monopoly on particular forms of communication. They’ve also had difficulty explaining the automated methods they use to monitor the activities of users who threaten violence or spread conspiracy theories, opening them to accusations of bias.“It’s interesting they finally pulled the trigger,” Chris Meserole, a Brookings fellow who studies technology and US domestic and foreign policy, said of the Justice Department announcement. “I think the biggest point of vulnerability on social media platforms is anti-competitive behavior.”“To me, it always seemed this is the way it would play out is for folks who disagree with the way the tech platforms are targeting the alt-right in particular or folks like Alex Jones,” Meserole said, referring to the far-right conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, a site recently banned by Apple, Facebook, and Google's YouTube, though it still lives on Twitter.“The leverage they have to get back on them is on they’re effectively a monopoly in control of online communication,” Mersole said.Wednesday’s announcement came amid a flurry of claims that social media algorithms were fundamentally unfair to conservative users.Many of those claims stemmed from a July story from Vice News that noted that some prominent Republican users’ names did not auto-populate when typed into the search bar. Twitter said that wasn’t an intentional attempt to hide conservatives, and that it was an algorithmic decision that makes it less intuitive to find users “who intend to manipulate or divide the conversation.”Vice called this act a “shadow ban,” a term that previously referred to a punishment sites used that made a user’s comments invisible to others. The phrase has since been adopted by conservatives who use Vice’s definition."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/5/20/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/original-30573-1536195302-1.jpg?crop=1024:536;0,147e336bf00bb06430fb235adc1f2be9514	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Georgia's Voting Plan Has Drawn New Criticism, This Time Over How It's Dealing With Voters Overseas	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Georgia's Voting Plan Has Drawn New Criticism, This Time Over How It's Dealing With Voters Overseas	0	"The state of Georgia has blocked all foreign internet traffic to its online voter registration site, BuzzFeed News has learned, a move that would do little to deter hackers but blocks absentee voters.The site, registertovote.sos.ga.gov, is accessible only to US IP addresses.The decision has outraged technologists and voting groups. In theory, it’s meant as a security measure, based on the idea that a person visiting the site is more likely to be a foreign hacker. But in practice, it has the opposite effect: Georgians abroad who don’t know how to reroute their internet traffic with tools like virtual private networks (VPNs) or Tor will be prevented from registering to vote.“This won't really do anything to dissuade a hacker. It will only turn away real voters,” said Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president of the US Vote Foundation, a nonprofit that helps Americans vote abroad. “A hacker, or even a determined voter, will just get onto a VPN and to a US IP address, and guess what? They’re in.”In an email sent June 16 to at least one Georgia county and obtained by BuzzFeed News, John Hallman, Georgia’s election systems manager, said that the state was preparing to block foreign traffic to its My Voter Page, the hub Georgians use to check their voter registration status and how to mail in voter applications, among other information.""For security purposes, we are going to be blocking international traffic to MVP during non-balloting time periods,” Hallman wrote.A spokesperson for Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is currently running for governor, defended the decision, saying that the actual PDF file that absentee voters would download and fill out is not blocked.“When we have received calls from ... voters who get to the webpage disclaimer, we walk them through the security explanation and provide assistance as needed,” she said.But voting technology experts say it’s a backwards system.“I don't think it makes sense to argue that just because the link to the PDF allows global IP access that absentee and (overseas) voters will be fine,” said Joseph Hall, the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.“Rather than block all global IP addresses outside the US, they really should be more selective in their blocking strategy,” Hall said.Georgia’s election setup is one of the most criticized in the country.

Discuss.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	An 11-Year-Old Changed The Results Of Florida's Presidential Vote At A Hacker Convention. Discuss.	0	"Election hackers have spent years trying to bring attention to flaws in election equipment. But with the world finally watching at DEFCON, the world’s largest hacker conference, they have a new struggle: pointing out flaws without causing the public to doubt that their vote will count.This weekend saw the 26th annual DEFCON gathering. It was the second time the convention had featured a Voting Village, where organizers set up decommissioned election equipment and watch hackers find creative and alarming ways to break in. Last year, conference attendees found new vulnerabilities for all five voting machines and a single e-poll book of registered voters over the course of the weekend, catching the attention of both senators introducing legislation and the general public. This year’s Voting Village was bigger in every way, with equipment ranging from voting machines to tabulators to smart card readers, all currently in use in the US.In a room set aside for kid hackers, an 11-year-old girl hacked a replica of the Florida secretary of state’s website within 10 minutes — and changed the results.Before Russian hackers targeted the 2016 US election process, hacking voting equipment was a niche issue. The Voting Village has changed that. “As far as broad social impact,” said Jeff Moss, DEFCON’s founder, “it is Voting Village” that has achieved the most notoriety in the conference’s history.But that attention has brought pushback. The day before the conference began, ES&S, one of the largest providers of election equipment in the US, sent an email to its customers assuring them that while “attendees will absolutely access some voting systems internal components ... Physical security measures make it extremely unlikely that an unauthorized person, or a person with malicious intent, could ever access a voting machine,” the company said.The National Association of Secretaries of State, the group that brings together each state’s top election official, issued an unusually testy statement against the Voting Village. “Our main concern with the approach taken by DEFCON is that it uses a pseudo environment which in no way replicates state election systems, networks, or physical security,” it said.“Providing conference attendees with unlimited physical access to voting machines,” NASS said, “does not replicate accurate physical and cyber protections established by state and local governments before and on Election Day.”The conflict brings into sharp relief the contrast between how cybersecurity research is usually conducted and the stodginess of government-approved election vendors and their customers.“I think the statement was misguided,” said Matt Blaze, a veteran election security researcher who helped organize the Voting Village. “It’s only through scrutiny that we’re going to have confidence in elections. That said, the fact that a system has vulnerabilities in it, even incredibly serious vulnerabilities, is not the same as saying any given election has been tampered with.”“There’s an interesting paradox.” Blaze said. “We know these systems are wildly insecure, and there’s been precious little evidence of these vulnerabilities so far being exploited in real elections. I think we’ve been very lucky, and I think there’s a little bit of a ticking time bomb here.”Since October 2016, when intelligence agencies first put forth a statement warning that Russia was attempting to interfere in the US election, the US government has walked a tightrope between warning that Russia was trying various tactics to influence the outcome and insisting that everyone’s vote was counted accurately. While a number of Russian tactics with a range of effects have been exposed — hacking and leaking Democrats’ emails, scanning state voter registration databases, and sending phishing emails to county employees — there is, as numerous agencies have repeatedly stated, no known evidence of foreign hackers ever changing a US vote tally. One of Russia’s fundamental goals with such attacks, analysts stress, is undermining Americans’ faith in democracy itself.“You have to balance raising awareness of vulnerabilities and pushing vendors to make more secure projects, which is a lot of what DEFCON is trying to do, with the ability for vendors to react to that,” said DHS’s top cybersecurity official, Jeanette Manfra, who spoke at the conference Friday. “And we have to explain that no, these are physically secure up until Election Day, then they’re wiped. There are all these other compensating controls that are in place.”“If you’re saying ‘even a kid can hack into this,’ you’re not getting the full story, which can have the impact of the average voter not understanding,” Manfra told BuzzFeed News.In the most fundamental sense, security researchers work by throwing the book at a piece of software, poking and prodding for any obscure or overt flaw in a program, usually causing developers to issue regular patches as vulnerabilities are discovered. Conferences like DEFCON provide a platform for both critical research and “stunt hacking,” flashy tricks that are often simple but designed to catch the broader public’s attention.But that process is anathema to voting equipment manufacturers for a number of reasons. Vendors have to follow some government guidelines and undergo certain audits, but they’re largely unaccountable to the public. Patching voting equipment that isn’t connected to the internet is difficult for many counties with little technical expertise, and vendors fall back on how unlikely it is that a registered poll worker or an elected official would have the time it takes to tamper with a voting machine. The vendors also point out that even if someone had the time to work a hack, the overall US election system is decentralized enough that as unlikely as hacking one machine is, a coordinated effort to hack them in bulk is even less likely.Copyright laws have previously made it difficult for researchers to legally acquire voting equipment to test it. With an incentive to assure customers that their product isn’t dangerous, vendors have historically lied outright about vulnerabilities they deemed unlikely to cause problems in the real world.One hacker at this year’s village, who requested anonymity because he didn’t want to tie his research to his day job as a programmer, took a Diebold TSX voting machine — versions of which are in use in at least some areas of 20 states — and turned it into a jukebox that played music from its tinny speakers and a display for an Illuminati GIF he found online."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/11/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-32459-1534011918-7.jpg?crop=1536:804;0,22024f05da7ce36487fbc59ceaf57e6544b	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Russian Hackers Targeted Swedish News Sites In 2016, State Department Cable Says	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Russian Hackers Targeted Swedish News Sites In 2016, State Department Cable Says	0	"At the same time that Russian military intelligence operatives allegedly penetrated Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, suspected Russian hackers were also targeting at least nine Swedish news sites in an apparent attempt to dissuade Sweden from cooperating with NATO, a partially released State Department cable reveals.The cable, which was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by BuzzFeed News and Ryan Shapiro, a PhD candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the cofounder of the transparency project Property of the People, was intended for internal use only. Sent Oct. 19, 2016, primarily to US ambassadors in Europe, it detailed US intelligence suspicions about Russian meddling in US the presidential election.It also warned that Russia was engaged in a widespread campaign to destabilize NATO alliances that included not only a disinformation campaign but the crippling cyberattacks against Swedish news organizations, which knocked several of the country’s largest news organizations offline.The cable is the first confirmation that Russia was suspected in the March 2016 attacks in Sweden, which came as the Swedish government was debating whether to approve a cooperation treaty with NATO. Sweden is not a member of NATO, but has grown closer to the organization in recent years in light of what Swedish officials called Russia’s willingness to use force in Georgia and Ukraine. News outlets reported at the time that some Swedish officials were pushing to join NATO outright, a sentiment that was echoed fearfully by a Russian think tank. The agreement was approved in May 2016.“Russia has focused significant resources on specific Partners, like Sweden and Finland,” the cable notes in a section marked SBU — sensitive but unclassified. “Russian actors are suspected of being behind recent efforts to infiltrate Sweden with distorted and false information about NATO in the Swedish press, at think tank events, and on social media.”It adds, “Russia is also suspected of carrying out cyberattacks against Swedish media outlets in March 2016.”The cable, portions of which were redacted because the information remains classified, is notable for using plain language to attribute the cyberattack’s likely perpetrator, something that the US government only does publicly with enormous care and as part of an intra-agency announcement, and never on an attack in which the US itself isn’t the victim.Asked for comment, a State Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that “the cable speaks for itself.”The cable came 12 days after the US government’s first public proclamation that Russia was interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Media coverage of that Oct. 7 joint statement was largely subsumed, however, by accounts of the infamous Access Hollywood tape that caught Donald Trump bragging about groping women and WikiLeaks’ publication of Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s emails.The attacks on Swedish media didn’t attract significant US attention, but they constituted a major event in Sweden. The attacks weren’t sophisticated — they were merely a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which overloads a network with too much traffic, keeping it from being able to load — but they were powerful enough to keep readers from accessing at least nine of the country’s biggest news sites.The timing of those attacks, which began March 19 and continued against at least some sites for five days, also is notable, in light of the indictment last month of 12 Russian military operatives by special counsel Robert Mueller. March 19 was also the day, according to the indictment, that a Russian intelligence officer named Aleksey Lukashev sent a spear-phishing email to Podesta. Two days later, according to the indictment, Lukashev and others downloaded the contents of Podesta’s email account.The Swedish government has never publicly blamed Russia for the media attacks, according to representatives for Polisen, the country’s national police; Sakerhetspolisen, a national security agency; and the country’s Foreign Ministry. At the time, police said that many of the IP addresses used in the DDoS were Russian, which is far from proof of a DDoS perpetrator’s identity, and that they were considering a full range of culprits, from a hostile nation-state to an angry teenager.Thomas Mattsson, the editor-in-chief of Expressen, Sweden’s second-largest paper and one of the victims, met with a number of government officials and politicians at the time over the attacks.“Everyone was suspecting this would have something to do with Russia, of course,” Mattsson told BuzzFeed News. “But it has not been declared in Sweden as fact.”Since then, many of the papers have hired cybersecurity firms to help thwart similar attacks. But there’s little hope of fully deterring dedicated government hackers.“If other nations could affect the US election, if hackers can break into the Pentagon, then it will obviously be difficult for newspapers, and regional newspapers in particular, to protect themselves,” Mattsson said."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/6/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-4044-1533590202-7.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230eae50aad04914d9fb6bacd8568cbe857	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		West Virginia Wants To Put Its Vote On The Blockchain. That's Either A Win Or A Disaster For Democracy.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	West Virginia Wants To Put Its Vote On The Blockchain. That's Either A Win Or A Disaster For Democracy.	0	"This spring, Joe Aoshima, an American linguist who lives in Japan, became one of the first 16 people to use a particular kind of app on their phone to vote in a US federal election.""I’m quite the technophobe, so I don’t really enjoy using technology,” he told BuzzFeed News. “But I really like the app.”Aoshima, 40, left West Virginia years ago, soon after he received his graduate degree from West Virginia University, situated in the state's Monongalia County. This May, absentee and military voters registered in Monongalia and in nearby Harrison County were given a unique opportunity: to forgo using a traditional postmarked paper ballot for the congressional primaries and simply check a box on a smartphone app instead.If West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner gets his way, those two counties are just the beginning. If all goes according to plan, he’ll announce in September that every county in West Virginia will offer that option. And then, he hopes, West Virginia can inspire the rest of the country to get on board what might make it easier for hundreds of thousands of vets and expats to vote in US elections.Or it could turn out to be a security nightmare.For Warner, a veteran whose four children are all either retired military or currently on active duty, using smartphones to make it easier to vote is personal.In 2014, while working a State Department job in Afghanistan, Warner experienced firsthand the frustration of trying to vote in the US from abroad — when an improvised explosive device took out a mail truck at a time that he was supposed to be sending in his ballot. “I went months at a time without getting mail into or out of Afghanistan,” he told BuzzFeed News.“I know from personal experience that many soldiers are having difficulty with the whole process,” Warner said. “Just so many hurdles or obstacles to voting that we need to lower those barriers, and make it easy for people out there on the front lines defending our democracy, to give them a right and the opportunity to participate. This mobile device voting is an answer to those issues.”It’s not just a few vets, either. More than 125,000 of the 369,000 absentee ballots mailed to active service members in 2016 didn’t end up being counted, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission.To find a way to offer easy access to voting, Warner’s office settled on Voatz, one of dozens of aspiring startups that rely on blockchain technology, a kind of digital ledger. Most famous as the concept that makes bitcoin possible, blockchain is the subject of its own inflated economy. Investment in blockchain-related startups has risen steadily since 2012, hitting nearly $1 billion in 2017.The idea of the blockchain is that it can’t be modified, only added to, and is simultaneously propped up by a network of users, rather than controlled by any one person. So in theory, it’s both an immutable record and accessible by anyone on the internet — two things that should work wonders for ensuring a vote is counted properly.A blockchain ledger is inherently less fallible than a paper ballot, which can be mishandled or tampered with, argues Voatz cofounder Nimit Sawhney. “Using the properties of the blockchain, once the vote’s written from the phone, nobody can change it, so being tamper-resistant is a big feature. Ensuring auditability and verifiability as well as post-election audit and keeping transparency, having your public ledger where you can see the votes coming in.”But things are different in practice, according to Matt Blaze, a renowned cryptographer and election security expert. In a landmark study in 2007, Blaze led teams of hackers to analyze possible software flaws in the various voting machines in use in California and Ohio — machines that had already passed numerous audits and which represented most of the companies whose equipment was in use at the time. Those states decertified some of that equipment, though some of the software they found flaws with is still in use.They found numerous vulnerabilities, most of which would only need a single knowledgeable user to exploit them. “In some cases, compromise of a single system component (such as a precinct voting machine) was sufficient to compromise not just the vote tally on that machine, but to compromise the entire county back end system,” Blaze testified before Congress last year.The central problem with trusting an American’s vote to a blockchain app, or to any app, for that matter, is that it means placing your complete trust in software, which by nature is invariably either buggy or exploitable and whose inner workings you can’t see, Blaze said. And trusting any computer program with your vote is a step backward.“You’re casting your vote to software,” Blaze explained to BuzzFeed News. “And what you’re sending is an electronic record that may or may not reflect what your actual choice was. The fundamental problem is you can easily verify the electronic representation of your vote was counted. But what we can’t verify is that’s how you intended to vote.”Voting security experts almost universally agree that the basic formula for trustworthy elections is for every vote to produce a paper trail so that the voter can see for herself that her vote is marked with her correct choice, and to conduct statistically significant audits of those paper receipts afterward to make sure the vote count doesn’t seem off. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, has declared ensuring ballots have a paper trail a matter of national security, and lawmakers keep trying to appropriate money to help states buy auditable equipment.One of Voatz’s top selling points, Sawhney said, is that the blockchain is a flawless record keeper. A recount would be unnecessary, because it’s impossible to go back and alter previous votes cast to it. Asking for a recount would be like repeatedly putting the same equation into a calculator. But even if one did place their trust in the Voatz software to communicate their vote electronically, it’s impossible to check.Security concerns and US regulations prevent the Voatz app from telling voters outright how they voted. Instead, if gives users a QR code, available only on the device used to cast that vote. “You then have to take your phone to an official polling place or other designated location — it could be a public library,” to verify what Voatz recorded as your choice, Sawhney said.But that’s little comfort to anyone living abroad uses the app to cast a vote in the United States.Here’s how Voatz works, in practice. Aoshima or any of the 15 other people who used the Voatz app to cast their vote earlier this year started by downloading the app for free from the Android or Apple store, like any other app. They registered by inputting the same information they'd given to their county to register as an absentee voter into the app. Then they uploaded a photo of a government ID and a selfie for Voatz to verify their identity.Once someone actually cast a vote, Voatz sent their choice to a specific blockchain that the company set up for the West Virginia primaries. Once the voting period was over, Voatz physically brought to county clerks a USB flash drive which the clerks used to unlock the ballots from a cloud storage site that Voatz had set up. Those clerks, alongside observers from opposing political parties, put those USB sticks into a computer, opened up Excel to read a list of voters and how they chose and together counted each vote for one candidate or another — the same process they would use if they were opening up physical mail for an absentee ballot.“It was kind of hectic in the beginning,” said Susan Thomas, the clerk in Harrison County.“Still a little iffy,” she said. “I think the security aspect of it, not the voting part, but the end when it gets here, needs to be changed.”Sixteen voters is a small sample size, but Voatz users repeatedly told BuzzFeed News that while they had trouble with the app they were optimistic for its future.“I literally emailed them twice a day for like a week,” Aoshima said. “I emailed them countless times. They took me step by step, but it was really easy. Any user problems were mine.”“I had an initial issue logging into the site, but the support staff helped me out immediately,” said Megan Casey, a 36-year-old lieutenant commander in the US Public Health Service.Lewis Anderson, an 18-year-old who was born in the US while his New Zealander father taught at WVU, used the app to vote for the first time. The app didn’t work at all, showing random characters instead of text. “I almost gave up,” Anderson said, until tech support realized his phone’s language setting was Australian, whereas the app only worked in American English. After changing that, “the app was really nice,” Anderson said.Sally Luce, a 70-year-old West Virginia native living in Canada, said she and her husband had trouble getting the app to work on their Android phones and spent significant time with Voatz support. “The man who helped me stayed on the line while I voted to ensure that the voting was successful,” Luce said. “This was not at all private, but I decided to proceed in order to get my vote counted.”“If the system is better created to accept online votes, it would certainly be a convenient alternative to mail delivery and subsequent posting of paper ballots, but I have a number of concerns,” Luce told BuzzFeed News.Even a handful of minor issues with a voting app could be disastrous if widely deployed, said Blaze, the security expert.“Encouraging participation is a legitimate civic goal, and the extent to which you can help people vote who otherwise would have difficulty voting is laudable,” Blaze said. “When you scale this up to something as large as a public election, and as important as a public election, any problem with an app like that, no matter how many audits it might have passed, is catastrophic.”Voatz’s security and logistical problems are significant, said Thomas, the Harrison County clerk. “We probably won’t be doing this in my lifetime,” she said."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/7/9/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-25114-1533650110-4.jpg?crop=1596:835;0,228f48e5c3786794a088ecd335fcdb6a20d	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		A Senator Claims That Russian Hackers Are In Florida's Voter Systems. Local Officials Are Skeptical.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	A Senator Claims That Russian Hackers Are In Florida's Voter Systems. Local Officials Are Skeptical.	0	"Florida Sen. Bill Nelson claimed Wednesday that Russian hackers “right now” are “in [the] records” of county election offices, prompting confusion from Florida state and county officials who said they are unaware of such an attack.Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times, Nelson said that the hackers “have already penetrated certain counties in the state and they now have free rein to move about.”In an email to Florida’s 67 county supervisors shared with BuzzFeed News, Florida's secretary of state, Ken Detzner, said he “has received zero information from Senator Nelson or his staff that support his claims.”“Additionally, the Department has received no information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that corroborates Senator Nelson’s statement and we have no evidence to support these claims. If Senator Nelson has specific information about threats to our elections, he should share it with election officials in Florida,” Detzner said.DHS itself contradicted Nelson's claim. “While we are aware of Senator Nelson’s recent statements, we have not seen any new compromises by Russian actors of election infrastructure,” a department spokesperson said.Florida voters go to the polls Aug. 28 to pick candidates for the November general election. Early voting begins Aug. 18.A number of Florida counties, including Bay, Bradford, Duval, Okaloosa, Okeechobee, Orange, and Pinellas, told BuzzFeed News they were unaware of any hacking of their computer systems in 2018.“If I were a US senator and I knew my state’s voter records had been penetrated by an outside source I wouldn’t hold a press conference or release a letter to the media without first providing that data to my secretary of state and my county supervisors of elections,” said Mike Duval, the supervisor of elections in Duval County, where Jacksonville is located. “We are already voting — thousands of mail ballots have been returned. Early voting for my county starts in five days. I am more than disappointed by such vague information as presented by Senator Nelson.”“I am totally unaware of what Senator Nelson was specifically referencing,” said Terry Vaughan, the supervisor of elections for Bradford County in the north-central part of the state.Paul Lux, the supervisor of Okaloosa County elections, said he'd spoken with election chiefs in nearly half of Florida’s 67 counties and that none had received information from Nelson or the Department of Homeland Security.“As Sen. Rubio and I wrote in our letter to the 67 county supervisors of elections, the threat is real and elections officials — at all levels — need to address the vulnerabilities,” Nelson said a statement emailed to BuzzFeed News after the comments.In recent press briefings and congressional hearings, the Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly stressed it has seen no coordinated Russian effort to hack any election-related infrastructure, the way that it had in 2016.In late September 2016, US intelligence concluded that there was a credible and specific Russian threat to Florida counties. Representatives from the FBI and DHS requested the heads of each county join for an emergency conference call in which they instructed those county heads to block a certain range of IP addresses they believed Russian hackers were using in the operation.While some county chiefs found it an example of the system working properly, others didn’t bother to participate in the call.In his comments, which the Tampa Bay Times included in its story online, Nelson repeatedly referenced a letter he wrote with fellow Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in July, which noted that Russian hackers were believed to have targeted Florida counties ahead of the 2016 election. The letter makes no mention of 2018 activity. In his comments to the Times, Nelson suggested the computer intruders could create havoc by deleting people from voter rolls.Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued a statement that didn’t address whether he’d seen intelligence suggesting Russian hackers were currently in Florida's system.“Russian activities continue to pose a threat to the security of our elections, as Senators Nelson and Rubio rightly pointed out in their letter,” Warner said. “I hope all state and local elections officials, including Florida’s, will take this issue seriously.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/9/9/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/a-senator-claims-that-russian-hackers-are-in-flor-2-25872-1533820367-4_dblbig.jpg9ba8fd2fbc7f466895531d0ca08000b4	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		What Did We Learn From That White House Briefing On Election Security? That No One's In Charge.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	What Did We Learn From That White House Briefing On Election Security? That No One's In Charge.	0	"On Thursday, the White House convened a press conference with its top intelligence officials to present, for the first time since Trump took office in January 2017, a united stance on election security.But while the heads of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Security Agency each presented a promise that they had clear jurisdiction for securing certain elements of the US election process, the news conference made one thing clear: There remains no single, overarching coordinator of US election security.“In a normal White House, there would be a point person at the White House, on the National Security Council, to coordinate all the different agencies and to work with the states and the social media companies to make sure our democracy isn’t so vulnerable to attack,” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told BuzzFeed News.“Today’s display, while intended to reassure the American people that the White House is on top of this problem, instead to me emphasized that there isn’t any one person in charge, and that there is apparently still no formal process for interagency coordination to address this threat,” he said.In March, President Trump hired John Bolton to head the NSC. Bolton reportedly clashed with his cybersecurity coordinator, Rob Joyce, causing Joyce to leave for the NSA the following month. Bolton then controversially eliminated the position entirely.“For almost any cybersecurity-related issue, the federal government is most effective when it brings all of its capabilities to bear in a coordinated fashion,” Michael Daniel, who served as NSC cybersecurity coordinator during President Obama’s second term, told BuzzFeed News. “If agencies are not working together, then at best the government’s response will be weaker than it could be and at worst agency actions could actually interfere with each other.”In a letter released Thursday responding to five Democratic senators’ request for White House commitment to election security, Bolton made no mention of an overarching coordination of election security, though he mentioned the NSC has held two meetings on the subject. “As you know, elections are administered by states and localities, and the federal government's appropriate role is one of supporting their efforts,” Bolton wrote.Each of the agencies has been clear about their roles, if not always forthcoming about specifics, when it comes to protecting elections. The FBI manages a Foreign Influence Task Force, which director Christopher Wray said at the press conference is set to counter a range of activities, including planting fake news stories and engaging in illegal campaign finance operations.DHS takes the lead on protecting election infrastructure, such as aiding states on protecting voter registration databases. And while the NSA and Cyber Command’s actions are more shrouded in secrecy, the agencies’ director, Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, said Tuesday, “My guidance and the direction from the president’s secretary of defense is very clear: We’re not going to accept meddling in the elections, and it’s very unambiguous.”But despite those agencies’ efforts, no one was the clear commander of the briefing. That reflects that no one is responsible for coordinating the agencies' widely divergent responsibilities.Warner said the lack of an official clearly identified as responsible for coordination could lead to an inability to respond to a multifaceted threat in November, Warner said.“We’re just three months away from Election Day, and we still don’t have a whole-of-government strategy for dealing with this problem,” Warner said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/2/20/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/what-did-we-learn-from-that-white-house-briefing--2-13659-1533257000-1_dblbig.jpg8c68cbfe255c4725994fdf9be58af4d8	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		An Accused Border Patrol Agent Told His Friend That Going To Work Was Like Going To War Every Day	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	An Accused Border Patrol Agent Told His Friend That Going To Work Was Like Going To War Every Day	0	"But there's still no explanation of what sent Juan David Ortiz on a murderous rampage. “I never in a million years would picture him doing something like this,” said a friend.Webb County Sheriff's Office Juan David OrtizLAREDO, Texas — Juan David Ortiz had a cloud hanging over him in the days leading up to his alleged killing spree that left four women dead along the side of desolate Texas roads. The normally reserved 35-year-old, a native Texan, was quieter than usual while he watched football with a group of friends on Aug. 30, said Jerry Solis, who served as the Border Patrol agent's best man at his wedding and had known him since they were both stationed at Twentynine Palms military base in California. Ortiz also had been taking antidepressants, and Solis saw him throw back two pills while drinking heavily. His friends told him to take it easy or else he'd build a tolerance. Ortiz went home early because he had to work the next day as an intelligence supervisor for the US Border Patrol. Four days later, according to authorities, Ortiz took Melissa Ramirez to an isolated road in South Texas and fired multiple shots into her head. As far as authorities know, Ramirez's Sept. 3 killing was the first of four that Ortiz would commit before his arrest on Sept. 15. He confessed to the killings, authorities said. “He was a quiet dude, real conservative, smart, grew up in the church. I'm shocked,” Solis told BuzzFeed News. “I was his best man at his wedding. I never in a million years would picture him doing something like this.” Solis is trying to square the man he'd spent hours alongside, hunting and fishing, with the “monster” being described in news accounts. Perhaps it was the strain of his job as a Border Patrol agent or a new relationship he’d started behind his wife’s back with a woman who resembled Ramirez. Authorities, friends, and family of the deceased are also trying to find a motive for the killings. Authorities have described the deceased as drug users and sex workers who made a living on the streets of the small border city of Laredo, Texas. “It's difficult to get into the mind of the killer, but what we have right now and what we do know is that Ortiz carried these murders out in a cold and callous way,” Webb and Zapata County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz told reporters. Webb County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Federico Garza said that shortly after his arrest, Ortiz expressed a dislike for the community he targeted but declined to go into specifics. Ortiz had established a relationship with the women who walked down San Bernardo Avenue late at night, and some of the victims “came along” with the Border Patrol agent several times before his alleged two-week killing spree. “He knew the victims and the victims knew him, some of them,” Garza told reporters. “He mentioned a dislike for the community the victims represented. ... Whatever anger he had inside of him, we don't know yet his complete motive.”Susan Montoya Bryan / AP A candlelight vigil in downtown Laredo for the four women.According to the arrest warrant, Ramirez is a key point in some of the other killings. On Sept. 13, for example, Ortiz is accused of killing Claudine Ann Luera outside of the Laredo city limits, after she became nervous and began accusing Ortiz of being the last person seen with Ramirez before her death. How authorities know what Luera said to Ortiz before her death is not clear, but according to the arrest warrant, Ortiz shot her multiple times in the head with his handgun. She was discovered lying on the side of the road by a truck driver. She died at at a nearby hospital. A day later, Ortiz allegedly picked up Erika Peña, who would help lead authorities to Ortiz. Like Luera, she also started to talk about Ramirez before he pointed his black handgun at her. She ran from his moving truck after pulling free of the shirt he'd been holding to keep her inside, and was able to get to a state trooper who was refueling at a gas station. That same night, though, Ortiz allegedly picked up Griselda Alicia Hernandez Cantu, also known as Guiselda Alicia Hernandez, and, later, Janelle Ortiz, taking them to isolated highways before shooting them in the head. The cold and calculated killer described by authorities is at odds with the suburban life friends say Ortiz built over the years in the border city of about 236,000 mostly Latino residents. He went to church on Sunday with his wife and was devoted to his two kids. The family lived on a quiet street in San Isidro Ranch, a community about 12 miles from downtown Laredo filled with newly built houses painted different shades of yellow, white, and gray. On a recent evening, none of the lights were on inside Ortiz's ranch-style home. Ortiz was the oldest in his family and was raised primarily by a devout mother and a grandfather, Solis said. Ortiz grew up in the church, was an altar boy, and could quote the bible easily when Solis met him at San Bernardino County’s Twentynine Palms military base in 2003. He grew up near the border in Brownsville, Texas. Ortiz enlisted in the Navy on July 5, 2001, shortly after turning 18, and became a medic, earning the rank of hospital corpsman second class and the nickname “Doc.” In addition to his posting at Twentynine Palms, he was stationed in San Antonio, Texas; Camp Pendleton, California; and Great Lakes, Illinois. He was awarded the joint meritorious unit award, the national defense service medal, and the rifle marksmanship ribbon during his service years. He left the Navy on May 4, 2009, weeks before his 26th birthday. Juan Benavides, the special agent in charge of the US Customs and Border Protection's Houston office of professional responsibility, said there was nothing in Ortiz's record to indicate he would kill four women. There was one minor allegation, that authorities declined to elaborate on, filed against Ortiz that was investigated, but nothing rising to the level of the acts he's accused of committing, Benavides said. The allegation didn't lead to any discipline. Ortiz joined CBP in 2009 at a time when there was a rush to fill the agency's ranks and a relaxation of hiring standards. In congressional testimony in 2015, Gil Kerlikowske, then the head of CBP, said that the rush to double the number of Border Patrol agents after the 9/11 terrorist attacks had allowed bad actors to join the agency's forces. Ortiz worked for the Laredo sector the entire time he was a Border Patrol agent. At a press conference on Monday, US Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost maintained that there has been no lowering of standards and that her agents go through an extensive hiring process. There are close to 6,000 Border Patrol agents in South Texas, and Ortiz's actions aren't indicative of the rest of the force, Provost said. Ortiz is the second Border Patrol agent from the Laredo sector accused of multiple murders this year. Ronald Burgos-Aviles, a 28-year-old Border Patrol agent, was arrested in April on two counts of capital murder, after reporting that he had found the bodies of his girlfriend, 27-year-old Grizelda Hernandez, and her 1-year-old son, Dominick, near a park in South Texas. He pleaded not guilty to murder charges last month. Another agent is under investigation for the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Guatemalan woman, Claudia Patricia Gómez González, in the nearby border hamlet of Rio Bravo. Ortiz is the latest Border Patrol agent to land in the national spotlight. “He loved his wife and he loved his kids. He'd talk about them all the time,” Solis said. “They had a big wedding and I'm pretty sure his life revolved around his kids. He was dedicated and wanted the best for his family.” It was his kids and wife that he thought of the night he was arrested. In two separate Facebook posts right before his arrest, Ortiz wrote, “To my wife and kids, I love u,” after posting “Doc Ortiz checks out. Farewell,” in what some have interpreted as a suicide message.Webb County DA's officeDespite his apparent devotion to his wife, Solis said that a couple of weeks before the first woman was killed, Ortiz showed him two pictures of a girl he said he’d just met. One looked a lot like Ramirez, the first victim. “I can't guarantee it, but she looked like the first one he killed; she looked a lot like her,” Solis said. “I remember telling him, “You better be careful... I hope you know what you're doing.’” A sex worker and a homeless man who frequent the area where Ortiz picked up the women said they'd seen a white truck, much like the Dodge Ortiz owns, drive down San Bernardo Avenue and surrounding streets to pick up girls for “dates” in the last two months. But Solis said he doesn’t believe Ortiz ever picked up sex workers or used drugs. But he did drink heavily and took antidepressants. Solis said he was shocked to hear Ortiz was depressed, and gave him a hard time when he found out he was taking medication, but Ortiz said the pills helped him brighten up with work colleagues. “He told me he felt no stress, he felt untouchable, he felt awesome,” Solis said.Erik Aguilar Juan David Ortiz, left, and Erik Aguilar during their years in the service.Erik Aguilar, a Marine who served with Ortiz, said the last time he saw him was in 2004, but that he kept in touch with him online and via text. He remembers Ortiz as a funny but professional guy. A conservative Christian, Ortiz wouldn't go out with the rest of the men when they went to clubs to party and meet women. “He was a really, really quiet guy,” Aguilar told BuzzFeed News. “We never saw a temper on him at all; he was always smiling and joking.” Ortiz joined the Border Patrol because he wanted to help immigrants with his medical background and ability to speak Spanish, noting that many migrants walk for days with little to no water before making it to the United States, Aguilar said. When huge numbers of unaccompanied minors started arriving at the US–Mexico border in 2014, Aguilar recalls Ortiz saying he was concerned by the risks the kids were taking with their lives to get into the country. Eventually the job started to take a toll on Ortiz, Aguilar said. He’d say that going to work was like going to war every day, because of safety concerns along the border, and was “very stressful.” Aguilar asked him why he didn't quit. “He said, ‘No, man, I really believe we're helping people. This is something that I love,’” Aguilar said. “He was a very compassionate guy in that sense; he really believed in what he was doing.” When Aguilar saw the Facebook posts on Ortiz's wall, he thought his friend was about to commit suicide. Aguilar, like other friends, called him on his cell, but got only his voicemail. “We all thought he was suicidal. Nothing in our minds would lead us to believe that he would kill all of these women,” Aguilar said. Webb County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Federico Garza believes Ortiz did try to commit suicide by cop when he was eventually found hiding in the back of a pickup truck inside the multilevel parking lot of a hotel. Ortiz, who had gone to use the restroom inside a Valero gas station, had run from two state troopers who recognized him. By then, Erika Peña had escaped and provided authorities with a description of Ortiz and his truck. Right before he was arrested, Ortiz brandished his cellphone like a weapon in an attempt to force authorities to shoot him, Garza said. “He tried to use his phone like it was a weapon,” Garza told reporters. Ortiz, who was charged with second-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, third-degree unlawful restraint, and four counts of first-degree murder, continues to be held under suicide watch. Members of Congress are asking CBP to investigate whether Ortiz used any government vehicles, weapons, databases, or knowledge as a Border Patrol agent to commit the alleged crimes. Though the investigation is ongoing, local authorities don't believe he used his position to kill the four women. He’s on indefinite unpaid suspension from the Border Patrol, and prosecutors are mulling whether to pursue capital murder charges — which would make him eligible for the death penalty. “It's just sad, very sad,” Aguilar said. “He must have had such gross thoughts in his head, something I cannot grasp in my head even a week later.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/21/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-21772-1537551999-11.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230d2216a56162e4edabea470ec16b23ac2	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		A Border Patrol Agent Has Been Arrested For Allegedly Killing Four Women	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	A Border Patrol Agent Has Been Arrested For Allegedly Killing Four Women	0	"Law enforcement officers gather near the scene where the body of a woman was found near Interstate 35 north of Laredo, Texas, on Saturday.Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar confirmed in a statement that the 35-year-old had murdered the four victims within the past two weeks. Ortiz, a Navy veteran, had been with the US Customs and Border Protection agency for 10 years.Juan David Ortiz, a supervisor for the Border Patrol, was arrested by the Texas Rangers early Saturday morning in relation to multiple homicides in and around Laredo, Texas.A US Border Patrol agent suspected of killing four women was arrested Saturday after a fifth woman escaped and notified law enforcement, who referred to the agent as a ""serial killer.""Webb County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz described Ortiz as a ""serial killer"" who preyed on sex workers whom he picked up at bus stops and parking lots in the Laredo area. In the last two weeks, Alaniz said, Ortiz killed four women, one of whom was transgender.""He would take these women out to desolate highway areas, and once he got them there he would take them out of his truck and execute them,"" Alaniz told BuzzFeed News.All of the victims were shot in the head — some in the face — with a handgun, Alaniz said. Ortiz is suspected of killing the four women while he was off duty. Investigators do not yet know if he used a service weapon in the killings.Two of the victims were identified as Melissa Ramirez and Claudine Ann Luera. The other two have not been identified.The fifth victim, who was able to escape from Ortiz, said he took her to his house and began to act ""weird"" when she started to talk about one of the other women he allegedly killed, whose body had been found the week before, according to the criminal complaint.Ortiz and the woman left his house in his pickup truck and stopped at a gas station that was three or four blocks from a Border Patrol station, Alaniz said.The fifth victim then again brought up the woman who had been killed, and that's when Ortiz pulled out a black pistol and pointed it at her, according to the complaint.According to the document, Ortiz tried to prevent her from exiting the truck, grabbing her shirt, but the woman pulled the shirt off and ran away from the moving vehicle, toward a state trooper, whom she asked for help.About an hour later, state troopers located the truck and tried to question Ortiz, who ran to a multilevel hotel parking garage. He was eventually found hiding in the bed of a truck, Alaniz said.Prosecutors said that after the woman escaped, Ortiz, a married man with children, picked up a Jane Doe in Laredo. The Border Patrol agent drove her out of the city limits on Interstate 35 and told her to exit at mile marker 20. He shot her in the head multiple times before driving back to Laredo.That same night, Sept. 15, Ortiz picked up another victim and again drove them out of the city limits. He told them to exit his truck at mile marker 15 and shot them in the back of the head. Ortiz, who confessed to the Texas Rangers, told authorities the body was behind gravel pits. Webb County deputies found the body and a single bullet casing.Ortiz, a Navy veteran, admitted to killing the four women between Sept. 3 and Sept. 15, the district attorney said. He added that there was no indication Ortiz had murdered additional women.""They did not deserve to die the way they did,"" Alaniz said of the victims.Ortiz was charged with second-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, third-degree unlawful restraint, and four counts of first-degree murder.""We want to reassure the citizens of Laredo that the community and your families are safe,"" the Laredo police, which had been assisting in the investigation, said in a statement Saturday.In a statement, CBP spokesperson Andrew Meehan said that the agency was assisting in the investigation into Ortiz, and that the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general had been notified.""Our sincerest condolences go out to the victims’ family and friends. While it is CBP policy to not comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, criminal action by our employees is not, and will not be tolerated,"" Meehan said. ""Out of respect to the victims’ family and friends, we ask that deference and due process be given to the investigation so that all the facts are brought to light and they can receive the closure they deserve.”Ortiz is the second Border Patrol agent from the Laredo sector accused of multiple murders this year. Ronald Burgos-Aviles, a 28-year-old Border Patrol agent, was arrested in April on two counts of capital murder, after reporting that he found the bodies of his girlfriend, 27-year-old Grizelda Hernandez, and her 1-year-old son Dominick Hernandez near a park in South Texas.Burgos-Aviles pleaded not guilty to the murder charges last month.Ortiz joined CBP in 2008, amid a relaxation of hiring standards aimed at boosting the agency's ranks. In congressional testimony in 2015, Gil Kerlikowske, then the head of CBP, said that the rush to double the number of Border Patrol agents after the 9/11 terrorist attacks had allowed bad actors to join the agency's forces.""When we lowered our standards of hiring and did not properly vet people, we made mistakes in who got hired. And we paid a price for that and are continuing to pay a price for that,” Kerlikowske told the House of Representatives’ Appropriations Committee at the time."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/15/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-25877-1537054439-1.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,1155d970d2ab0204ed8945d451aa6f18479	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Hundreds Of Immigrant Parents Separated From Their Children Are Getting A Second Chance At Asylum	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Hundreds Of Immigrant Parents Separated From Their Children Are Getting A Second Chance At Asylum	0	"Hundreds of parents who were separated from their children at the border will have another chance to make their asylum claims as part of a settlement with the Trump administration.The settlement, filed late Wednesday and covering three major lawsuits over family separations, would allow at least 1,000 parents who failed their credible fear interviews a second chance at proving that they have a legitimate fear of persecution in their home countries.If either a parent or child establishes a credible fear of persecution or torture, the family will be able to apply for asylum together, the settlement said. In cases where a parent fails to pass a credible fear interview, they still will be able to stay with their child in the US if the child has a pending asylum case, according to the agreement.“It’s a huge deal that in this situation, where parents never really got a fair shot at their credible fear interviews, they’re getting a second chance,” Sirine Shebaya, senior staff attorney for Muslim Advocates, one of the organizations that filed a lawsuit, told BuzzFeed News. “This second look is something I’ve never seen at this scale.”Shebaya said the settlement could even give deported parents the chance to bring their claims before the government on a case-by-case basis. Many parents said they had been coerced into signing away their rights to seek asylum and agreeing to deportation, believing it was the only way to be reunited with their children.The family separations at the border this summer occurred after the government implemented its “zero tolerance” policy, filing charges against every adult caught trying to enter the US illegally. Because children couldn’t go with their parents into federal custody while they faced illegal entry charges, the families were forcibly separated.Audio and images of crying kids or children held in cages contributed to a massive outcry against the administration, forcing President Trump to rescind the policy in June.US immigration authorities were accused of coercing parents separated from their kids into signing documents, like deportation papers, or they would never see their children again. Other immigrant parents said they were misinformed, coerced, or tricked into waiving their rights to be reunited with their kids. In the end, many of the parents also failed their credible fear interviews.The separations also resulted in several federal lawsuits being filed. A San Diego lawsuit, referred to as the Ms. L case, forced the government to reunite more than 2,500 kids with their parents. Another federal lawsuit temporarily stopped the deportation of reunited families to give children a chance to follow through with their asylum claims.The lawsuit accused the government of systemically and unlawfully pushing the parents through the interviews while they suffered trauma at the hands of US authorities. The complaint also accused the Trump administration of using the negative outcomes as a result of the “defective credible fear interviews” to quickly deport them. Attorneys argued that pushing the parents through the interviews violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.The settlement covers all three lawsuits.Shebaya said the second look at asylum claims made by parents who received a negative outcome and were separated from their kids will allow them to submit more evidence and have attorneys represent them during the process.Parents who failed their credible fear interviews also will have a second chance to make their case again before an immigration judge, but in most cases the judge sides with the asylum officer. Receiving a negative determination by an asylum officer placed parents on the fast track to deportation.“Parents were so traumatized because they were separated from their child they were not in a position to provide the facts and evidence the asylum officer needed in order to make a credible fear determination,” Shebaya said. “They were not in a state of mind where they could go through and fully explain what happened to them.”The lawsuit, filed on behalf of 29 parents who were separated from their kids, alleged that parents were confused, disoriented, and unable to focus on anything beyond their children, and as a result were unable to articulate their fears of persecution or torture in their home countries.The government slammed the courthouse doors on this group of families, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director of the Immigrant Advocacy Program at the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia.“With the settlement, it’s not like we can open the courthouse doors but it gives each of them a chance to walk up to the door and see if they can pull it open,” Sandoval-Moshenberg told BuzzFeed News."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/13/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-5806-1536849753-3.jpg?crop=1228:642;0,17766aedb8608344f1c8ae1426392df4391	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Here's A Statistic You Won't Hear From Trump: Over 90% Of Families Seeking Asylum Show Up For Their Court Hearings	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Here's A Statistic You Won't Hear From Trump: Over 90% Of Families Seeking Asylum Show Up For Their Court Hearings	0	"Despite the Trump administration's assertion that immigrant families must be detained because they don't show up for court hearings, research shows that the vast majority of families released from detention attend all their scheduled court appearances.Overall, 86% of families released from immigration detention attended all of their court hearings, according to a study by the American Immigration Council that reviewed more than 18,000 immigration court hearings initiated between 2001 and 2016. That percentage exceeded 90% when only families who'd filed asylum applications were considered.The findings contradict the Trump administration's assertion in a recent proposal to revise a court agreement that limits how long children can be held in detention. ""In many cases, families do not appear for immigration court hearings after being released,"" the proposal said.But that claim is contradicted by a review of actual cases, said Ingrid Eagly, a law professor at UCLA and one of the authors of the immigration council's report ""Detaining Families: A Study of Asylum Adjudication in Family Detention.""""These high rates of reporting to court are inconsistent with government claims that families placed in detention will not report to court after release,"" Eagly told BuzzFeed News.Family detention has been a major issue for the Trump administration, which during the summer faced backlash for separating parents from their children at the border. Anger over family separation forced President Trump to rescind the policy in June after weeks of controversy.Since then, family separation has been a quieter issue as immigration authorities work to keep families together, releasing hundreds when the country's three family detention centers can hold no more detainees.But that calm is likely to be broken by the Trump administration's effort to overturn a 1997 court agreement known as the Flores settlement that regulates how immigrant children are to be treated while in custody. The agreement says that unaccompanied kids and children who arrive in the US with their parents should be released from detention generally within 20 days.On Friday, the Trump administration published in the Federal Register a proposed regulation that would supersede the Flores settlement agreement, and allow immigration authorities to detain entire families indefinitely. The publication opened a 60-day period for comment.Key to the government's efforts to revise the agreement is the claim that families released into the United States drop from sight.Thomas Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told a congressional committee in May that ""many"" undocumented families they are forced to release never make it to court.""And even when they do, many more fail to comply with the lawfully issued removal orders from the immigration courts,"" Homan said.In June, President Trump said immigration authorities simply release immigrants caught at the border with instructions to show up in court in a year.""But here’s the thing: That in itself is ridiculous. Like 3% come back,"" Trump said.White House legislative director Marc Short told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in June that ""Eighty percent of those that are coming here illegally never show up for court and are never deported.""In an October 2017 speech, Attorney General Jeff Sessions echoed what Homan and others in the administration said about asylum-seeking families who passed interviews with immigration officers stating they have a credible fear of returning to their home countries.""Not surprisingly, many of those who are released into the United States after their credible fear determination from DHS simply disappear and never show up at their immigration hearings,"" Sessions said.But the study shows that a vast majority of families who are not in detention do attend their immigration court hearings.Of 13,037 families released from detention, 11,212, or 86%, showed up to all of their hearings; the 1,825 who didn't were ordered to be deported, according to the American Immigration Council study.When researchers looked at only cases where a judge had issued a decision, 6,587 families, they found that the court appearance rate was 72%, overall, but went up to 92% for asylum applicants. That percentage rose to 94% if the family had filed an asylum application and had an attorney.Other studies of families who've been released under various ICE programs, which include ankle monitors, cash bonds, and caseworkers, also show a high rate of attendance at court hearings.An analysis from the Cato Institute, a DC-based libertarian think tank, found that for people being monitored electronically, appearance rates at immigration courts were 99.6% in 2012, the last year with reliable data. The Family Case Management Program, though expensive at $18,000 per immigrant, had a 100% court appearance rate. The Trump administration killed the program in mid-2017.During his October 2017 speech, Sessions said that in 2016 there were 700% more deportation orders issued to people who didn't show up in court in cases that started with a credible fear claim, a crucial first step in an asylum case, compared with 2009. However, Sessions didn't say what the actual numbers of deportation orders were in those cases.A Department of Justice report shows that asylum applicants who were ordered deported when they were not in court had dropped when you compare 2009's 3,313 to 2016's 2,926. Overall, deportation orders issued for all immigrants who didn't show up to court increased from 16,491 in 2012 to 40,579 in 2017.In justifying the administration's statements that many immigrants don't keep their court dates, the Department of Homeland Security provided figures for fiscal year 2017 that show the agency arrested 104,950 family units along the southwest border and encountered another 76,157 — usually people who presented themselves at ports of entry seeking lawful admission into the US who were later found to be ""inadmissible.""About 95% of them are still in the country, the agency said, but that most likely is due to their cases being undecided. The immigration court backlog has reached an all-time high of 697,777.DHS said that of the families issued a final deportation order, 76% of them did not show up to their required court hearings, but the actual numbers that make up that percentage are small when you look at the overall number of families arrested at the border in 2017. Of the family units apprehended, 7,080 were issued deportation orders, of which 5,339, or 76%, were issued to someone not present in court.Eagly cast doubt on the significance of those figures, however, accusing the Trump administration of looking only at one year of data or a few months, rather than statistics spanning several years.""There's been a wide variety of stats that the administration has put forward in the past month without putting forward any clear methodology as to how they actually measured,"" Eagly said.An analysis by the Justice Department found that between fiscal year 2012 and 2016, a majority of immigrants who were not detained attended their court. Those percentages ranged from 57 to 76%. This included immigrants who were never held in immigration jails and those who were released from detention.In 2015, of the 88,267 immigration decisions, about 38,260 were issued without the person being in court. It was the highest in absentia rate, which refers to cases where immigrants do not appear in court court, 43%, of the years provided.According to the Justice Department, 2012 had the lowest in absentia rate, at 24% for immigrants not in detention. That year, of the 81,593 immigration decisions, 19,365 people did not show up to court for the final hearing.A total of 139,231 nondetained immigrants were ordered to be deported without showing up to their court proceedings from 2012 to 2016. It's unknown whether these people remained in the country or left or how many of those were families.Eagly said the reason why families seeking asylum have high rates of showing up for their court hearings is because of the emphasis legal advocates have put on providing information to that specific group.""With a lawyer explaining the immigration court process, I think people are more likely to understand what the process is and where and when they need to go,"" Eagly said. ""A lot of the reason why people don't appear is because they don't have the proper information regarding the court process, and having a lawyer can make a big difference in whether or not people appear.""Casey Miller, a legal assistant with the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, who works with mostly asylum-seeking families at the Karnes County Residential Center, in Karnes City, Texas, said legal services make a difference when it comes to court appearances.""Especially when we give them exact information about what they need to do in order to go to their court appointments and ICE check-ins,"" Miller told BuzzFeed News.Because some families who are not in detention may have been at some point, legal aid providers often reach out to them there and continue to work with them after they're released.Many adult detention centers don't offer legal services, Miller said, leaving thousands of immigrants without attorneys on their own to sort through mountains of English-language court documents, find transportation to courthouses, especially if they don’t live in a major city, and keep tabs on changing court dates.“There are many reasons why families don't show up to their court dates, but I would say that the primary reason is that the American legal system is difficult to navigate, even as an educated English speaker,” Miller said."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/10/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-2203-1536617730-1.jpg?crop=1452:760;0,2085c016133c35a42ccaf184e040248939b	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		The Trump Administration Is Trying To Hold Immigrant Kids In Detention Indefinitely	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	The Trump Administration Is Trying To Hold Immigrant Kids In Detention Indefinitely	0	"Yessica, 13, was separated from her father after they tried to cross into the United States.The Trump administration is attempting to get out from under a federal court agreement that limits how long it can hold children in immigration detention with the hope that it can hold families indefinitely.Under a 21-year-old court settlement known as the Flores agreement, the government can't hold children in immigration detention for longer than 20 days. The Trump and Obama administrations have challenged the restrictions before, because they force the government to quickly release children and their parents who've been caught trying to cross the US border. A federal court has rejected those efforts.Now the Trump administration is making a new effort to alter the agreement, saying that the knowledge that immigrant adults will be released with their kids encourages them to bring their children with them on the dangerous journey to the US.""The expectation that adults with juveniles will remain in the United States outside of immigration detention may incentivize these risky practices,"" the government said in its announcement Thursday that it was going to make another try at changing the Flores agreement.This time, the government is trying to circumvent one of the key aspects of the Flores agreement — that the facilities where children are held must be state-licensed — by setting up a separate federal licensing system.The Trump administration said most states don't offer licensing for family residential centers that detain immigrant children and parents together. The ones that do have had their licensing processes challenged and in one case invalidated.""It is difficult to continue to detain a family in a state-licensed facility,"" the government said in its rule proposal. ""The proposed rule would eliminate that barrier to the continued use of [family residential centers] by creating an alternative federal licensing scheme for such detention. The goal is to provide materially identical assurances about the conditions of confinement at that facility, and thus to implement the underlying purpose of the [Flores agreement's] licensing requirement.""The government will likely end up in court over the proposed changes before a judge who has ruled previously against efforts to modify the agreement. In July, US District Judge Dolly Gee rejected the Trump administration's bid to change the terms of the Flores settlement in an attempt to hold families together.Gee said then that holding kids in unlicensed facilities ""would constitute a fundamental and material breach"" of the settlement agreement.Under the proposed rule, the federal government would consider a facility licensed if it hires an outside entity to ensure that the location complies with standards set by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.""Under this proposed rule, the proposed rule may result in extending detention of some minors, and their accompanying parent or legal guardian, in [family residential centers] beyond 20 days,"" the draft regulations said.The government also said ""the primary purpose of this action is to promulgate regulations that would ultimately lead to the termination of the [Flores settlement agreement].""The change could allow the Trump administration to go back to applying its ""zero tolerance"" policy to families caught trying to enter the US illegally. It ended its scheme of prosecuting all adults caught entering the US after the uproar that greeted the government's systematic separation of 2,654 children from their parents.“Today, legal loopholes significantly hinder the Department’s ability to appropriately detain and promptly remove family units that have no legal basis to remain in the country,” Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement announcing the new rule proposal. “This rule addresses one of the primary pull factors for illegal immigration and allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/6/16/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/the-trump-administration-is-trying-to-hold-immigr-2-4313-1536266811-0_dblbig.jpgea4b8281c04646148c6de8534f8f39d0	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		How Welcome Are Refugees In Mexico?

The Tijuana Police Beat Migrants Who Speak Out.	0	"Irineo Mujica, shown here with the immigrant caravan that traveled to the US–Mexico border this spring, was beaten and arrested by Tijuana police on Tuesday.Two members of the group that led this spring’s immigrant caravan to the US–Mexico border were beaten and arrested by police in Tijuana late Tuesday, organizers said.Irineo Mujica, the head of Pueblo Sin Fronteras (""People Without Borders""), and Israel López, a Guatemalan national and caravan organizer, were attacked by a group of Tijuana officers before being arrested, said witness Jackson Davier Figueroa Maldonado, who traveled with the caravan when it left the Mexico–Guatemala border and remained in Tijuana. The pair were released from police detention Wednesday afternoon.According to Figueroa Maldonado, the group had gone to Tijuana's municipal police building in the Centenario district to ask about the arrest of a Honduran immigrant who also had been part of the caravan.While the Pueblo Sin Fronteras group was asking questions about the arrest, Figueroa Maldonado said, the cops became aggressive, especially after the group started to record them. Then one of the officers said he was going to arrest Mujica for ""public scandal.""""We defended him and said, 'No, don't arrest him,' and that's when four or five officers came out,"" Figueroa Maldonado told BuzzFeed News. ""They threw him on the ground and started to beat him.""López, who has participated in two caravans and ran the group's social media for the one in 2017, also was thrown to the ground, and three officers began to choke him, Figueroa Maldonado said. The cops then threatened the rest of the group and told them to leave before something worse happened.Mario Martinez, director for the Tijuana police, said Mujica was yelling and causing a scene inside a government building when he demanded the release of the Honduran immigrant.An official went out to meet the group of seven men and one woman, Martinez said. The official told them they would give the group information on the arrest but Mujica continued to raise his voice at authorities, Martinez said, which led to his attempted arrest.""He resisted arrest, throwing blows and kicks against the official hitting him on his leg and abdomen,"" Martinez told reporters at a press conference.The official asked for help from other officers in detaining Mujica, Martinez said.The Honduran immigrant who was arrested and the reason the group went to the police department was a 17-year-old minor. Martinez said the minor was detained due to ""security"" concerns because he was in an area known for drug sales, but added he had not broken any laws and that cops didn't know he was underage when they took him in.Martinez said there were multiple videos taken by the group with Pueblo Sin Fronteras and added that he welcomes the investigation from Tijuana's public ministry.""They got mad because we learned that when you talk to the police you have to record to have proof,"" Figueroa Maldonado said."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/5/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-2643-1536174979-8.jpg?crop=1596:835;0,229179b85a79f4f4c1fa7ef74fd840a01b0	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Caravan Members Who Stayed In Mexico Find Life Is A Struggle There, Too	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Caravan Members Who Stayed In Mexico Find Life Is A Struggle There, Too	0	"Police harassment and indifference from the authorities are common complaints of migrants who stayed in Mexico rather than crossing into the United States.Ariana Drehsler For Buzzfeed News One of the attendees at a workshop for new immigrants looks out at Tijuana.Yamileth feels rage whenever she recalls the night she was stabbed in the stomach. It was also the same day the Honduran migrant found out she was six weeks pregnant, Aug. 6. A woman she recognized from the Tijuana, Mexico, apartment building she lived in started yelling outside her door, accusing her of sleeping with her husband, an accusation Yamileth denied. The woman, who Yamileth described as drunk or high, barged through the front door to the apartment the 23-year-old shared with friends and started to hit her. When the woman head-butted her, Yamileth saw something in her right fist and seconds later she felt something plunge into her stomach. ""I moved back and yelled, 'My baby,' and that's when my friends pushed her out,"" Yamileth told BuzzFeed News. ""When the police finally arrived 40 minutes later they said they were expecting me to be more pregnant, to be showing more. They said, 'Don't worry about it. There's no point in arresting her if we're just going to let her go in a few hours.'""Handout from Yamileth A photo of Yamileth's stab wound.The dismissive response to assaults or other crimes from the Tijuana police is not uncommon for migrants who find themselves in the border city and often face harassment at the hands of local authorities. But unlike other migrants who are too scared or disillusioned to seek redress, Yamileth filed complaints against the police officers with both state and federal human rights commissions hours after she left the hospital. ""Not arresting her because she'll probably be released is not up to the police,"" Yamileth said. ""That's for a judge to decide."" Yamileth arrived in Tijuana this spring as part of the Central American migrant caravan that angered the Trump administration. When the caravan left the Mexico–Guatemala border on March 25 it was made up of more than 1,200 people who have since been scattered to other parts of Mexico, the United States, or back home. As many as 100 members of the caravan are currently living in Tijuana, trying to make a life there or planning their next move. Organizers with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group that set up the caravan, which ended in Tijuana in May, have been meeting twice a week with people from the caravan, hoping to prevent people like Yamileth from falling into the shadows like many Central Americans do when they find themselves in Tijuana. The group also has been helping migrants file complaints against mistreatment and exercise their rights in a region where migrants are often too fearful to file complaints against authorities. People from the caravan have filed at least 10 complaints against Tijuana police with the State Commission for Human Rights and three with the National Commission for Human Rights. ""We don't know this country, so we have this fear of not understanding the law, and perhaps the authorities take advantage of that,"" Yamileth said. ""I've learned a lot from these meetings. It's honestly something more people like me need here.""Ariana Drehsler For Buzzfeed News A workshop for immigrants meets twice a week above a cafe in Tijuana.Yamileth hopes she won't have to deal with Tijuana authorities for long. She hopes to ask for asylum in the United States, but has to wait for her cousin in the US to have enough money to be able to support her financially.Alex Mensing, Pueblo Sin Fronteras' project director, said it was not the organization's initial plan to build a grassroots team in Tijuana that could advocate for the rights of migrants, but that it made sense after they realized people from past caravans have remained in the area. ""Tijuana is a rough place. We heard stories about police abuse, people being turned over to Mexican immigration, people getting kidnapped, people getting robbed by organized crime,"" Mensing told BuzzFeed News. ""All of those things combined have led us to build a local grassroots ownership so people can take care of themselves."" Tijuana is one of Mexico's fastest growing cities, drawing large numbers of immigrants, according to a policy brief from the University of San Diego's Justice in Mexico research initiative. In 2017, Tijuana had more homicides than any other city in Mexico, in a record year for homicides in the country. From 2016 to 2017 Tijuana saw the number of investigations on homicide cases rise from 872 to 1,618, an increase of roughly 86% in just one year, according to the Baja California Ministry of Public Safety. Pueblo Sin Fronteras is planning a ""march for dignity"" on Saturday in Tijuana, demanding respect for human rights and a stop to detentions of migrants without reason at the hands of the Tijuana Police Department. ""If the municipal police actually has a commitment to reduce crime they should be working with people who are hardworking targets of crime and therefore often know what's going on and willing to participate with authorities to file reports,"" Mensing said. ""You would think they would both be on the same side, then the question becomes which side is the police really on?"" The Tijuana Police Department declined multiple requests for comment.Ariana Drehsler For Buzzfeed News Yamileth sits in Tijuana, Mexico.The people from the caravan who ended up in Tijuana aren't victims, Mensing said, and are slowly building the knowledge they need to respond when they believe they've been taken advantage of by authorities or criminals.At a recent meeting on a weekend afternoon, about 30 people from Central America who'd made their way to Tijuana in the past two caravans sat on chairs, the tops of crates, or on the floor as they listened to a Pueblo Sin Fronteras organizer speak about the importance of justice, unity, and tolerance, and attracting more people to their cause through those values. ""Power only respects power,"" said the organizer, who asked not to be identified because they have been harassed by border authorities when they entered the US in the past over their work with the caravan. ""We exercise our power to make change, and we need to grow our capacity by bringing in more people to our cause."" The caravan members, or caravaneros, as they sometimes refer to themselves in Spanish, listened as the organizer recounted the numerous obstacles they had lived through this spring: how President Trump had tried to destroy them, how the group refused to bend the knee to the US and Mexican governments, and how ultimately more than 320 people were able to ask for asylum. ""They tried to destroy us, but they couldn't because there is power in unity,"" the organizer said. ""We had more power because our numbers got the attention of the world, and the world identified with our values."" On one side of the room sat Argelia, a 33-year-old woman who was recently arrested by Tijuana police. The Guatemalan-born woman, who identifies as Honduran because that's where she was raised, said she was walking with two male friends to catch a bus back to their apartment when a young guy claiming to be an MS-13 member tried to rob them. She found it ironic that the same threats she and others were fleeing managed to find them so far from home. When the young guy pulled a knife, one of Argelia's friends pushed him to the ground right before the cops arrived. They arrested all of them, despite Argelia telling the cops they were the ones being attacked. ""Being locked up were the worst 12 hours of my life,"" Argelia told BuzzFeed News.Ariana Drehsler For Buzzfeed News Argelia sits in a cafe in Tijuana."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-09/2/12/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/caravan-members-who-stayed-in-mexico-find-life-is-2-20806-1535907164-8_dblbig.jpg735e52e507e04109877b9ff1ec1be010	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		An Army Director Hired To A Top Immigration Post Spewed Anti-Muslim Comments On Facebook — Then He Lost The Job	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	An Army Director Hired To A Top Immigration Post Spewed Anti-Muslim Comments On Facebook — Then He Lost The Job	0	"Guy Sands-Pingot, who once compared Islam to the Nazi Party in a Facebook comment, was hired as a deputy director at US Citizenship and Immigration Services. He will now not fill the role.FacebookA US Army director recently offered a job as deputy director of the federal agency that oversees immigration applications made anti-Muslim statements and posts on Facebook in recent years. Guy Sands-Pingot, who was at one point a brigadier general, was tapped to be deputy director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services and was slated to begin in mid-September. Sands-Pingot would have served under an administration that is seeking to significantly cut back on the number of legal and undocumented immigrants and has, with the travel ban, targeted Muslim-majority countries. He would have also helped oversee an agency that recently created a denaturalization unit. In October 2015, Sands-Pingot posted a link to an article from GOPTheDailyDose.com on Facebook with the headline “If you wipe your butt with your bare hand but consider bacon to be unclean, you may be Muslim.” The link on the page was dead but the headline has been part of anti-Muslim jokes spread on the internet for years, such as “If you were amazed to discover that cell phones have uses other than setting off roadside bombs, you may be a Muslim.”FacebookIn a comment from about two years ago, Sands-Pingot compared Islam to the Nazi Party. He said Muslim intellectuals and a “political axis” continually exonerate terrorist attacks as solitary acts of violence despite a clear connection. ""It would undermine their fantasy of their not being an islamic threat to the non-islamic world and peoples,"" Sands-Pingot wrote. ""This is similar to saying crimes committed by nazi storm troopers had nothing to do with the Nazi Party even though every propoganda [sic] point of the Nazi Party political and social platform clearly spelled out what they would do and why they would do it, and to whom they would do it to.""FacebookAfter BuzzFeed News asked USCIS about some of the material on Facebook, spokesperson Michael Bars said Sands-Pingot will no longer fill the role he was recently hired for.“After conducting a full and open competition in compliance with all Office of Personnel Management guidance for career vacancies in the Senior Executive Service, including assembling resume review and interview panels as part of the standard hiring process, a candidate was selected for the position of Deputy Director and a tentative job offer was extended, expected to commence mid-September,” Bars said. “At this point, however, the candidate is no longer slated to commence employment at USCIS,” he said. “USCIS is committed to equal employment opportunity, adherence to merit principles, and fair treatment for all employees.” Sands-Pingot didn’t return requests for comment at various email addresses, including his email alias at USCIS. After BuzzFeed News emailed USCIS and Sands-Pingot to inquire about the posts, his Facebook timeline viewing settings were restricted. He also liked a July post from conservative commentator Mark Levin with the headline ""IMMIGRANTS DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AND MAKE DEMANDS.""Sands-Pingot also commented on a Vox story from December 2015 about Malala Yousafzai's warning that Trump's rhetoric would radicalize more terrorists, suggesting there was no difference between people with an extremist interpretation of Islam, like those who shot Yousafzai, and other Muslims.""She was shot in the head by 'normal' conservatives that used the koran not only to justify their action, but to demand it be compulsory for other moslem females who dare to think they should receive an education,"" Sands-Pingot said. ""She became the 'posterperson' for all delusional leftist [sic] who think she is the face and body of a fictional 'moderate' islam.""FacebookAnd in August 2016, Sands-Pingot commented on a Guardian story describing a woman who led the call to prayer in a mosque in Europe, saying: ""Typical left wing , radical progressive guardian printed drivel...now she is the new, moderate, modern face of islam in the west to follow in order to legitimize more conversions from disaffected non-moslem females...really??"" That article was shared on the page of Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, a well-known commentator on the Middle East. Sands-Pingot also posted a link from the site of Pamela Geller, an anti-Islamic commentator, about a Swedish bishop calling for the church to remove crosses and install a Muslim prayer space. ""Interesting and alarming read of the results of 60 years of left wing 'well-meaning' radical socialist policies that now have taken root and is ready to supplant traditional Sweden society,"" Sands-Pingot wrote.FacebookIn the comments section of that post, a friend who said he stopped going to church when the ""Anglicans started ordaining women"" and ""Next you'll tell me we got women on submarines!""""Actually as of January in the SEALs....,"" Sands-Pingot said. In another Pamela Geller story purporting to be about a ""Muslim father"" killing a 4-year-old girl, Sands-Pingot said, “I would invite people to read the postings of young muslim men yo [sic] this blog...unbelievably threatening...and does not sound to be peaceful and merciful to me…”FacebookIn October 2013, he posted a Facebook status about the Saturday Night Live character Pat. The sketches revolved around people not knowing what gender Pat was.""[W]e are all in the 'Age of Pat'...to wit...multi-gender access for 'transgendered' 10-18 year olds to bathrooms in all California schools and many, many, many more examples that will not or cannot be mentioned here.

Almost without thinking, she wiped the mousse from her hands and headed for the front door. Then she paused and ran back for her cellphone before she walked out into her yard and hit record. If she hadn’t, there’d be almost no record of what took place May 23 outside her tall frame house in the Texas border hamlet of Rio Bravo when a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a young Guatemalan woman moments after she’d crossed the nearby Rio Grande. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the parent agency for the Border Patrol, issued two contradictory statements about the shooting, and the FBI and Texas Rangers, three months later, are still conducting investigations about which virtually nothing official is known — not the name of the agent who fired the fatal shot nor the names of the three undocumented immigrants who were taken into custody as material witnesses. Nor is there a definitive account of what led to the shooting. The case faded quickly from the news, overwhelmed by fury over the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy and the resulting family separations. Now immigrant advocates along the border are calling for more information, saying that the shroud of silence over the case is typical of incidents involving the Border Patrol, an agency that has been criticized for years over its use of force. Ilse Mendez, a spokesperson for the Laredo Immigrant Alliance, an advocacy group in the area, said it’s hard to get the Border Patrol to release any information on who the agent was and any relevant history such as whether the agent had been involved in prior shootings. “It may be even impossible, but we are still here, present, and willing to keep on bringing it up and we will continue to call out these injustices,” Mendez told BuzzFeed News. “It's not the first time that we’ve seen this happen to an undocumented individual. We see a lot of border deaths, people getting run over and shot by the Border Patrol.”Verónica G. Cárdenas for BuzzFeed News A shrine at the site of Claudia Patricia Gómez González's death.Claudia Patricia Gómez González was 20 years old when her life ended in the empty lot next door to Martínez’s home. She’d left her home on the outskirts of Quetzaltenango, a city that sits near the foot of a volcano, just 15 days earlier on what was surely an arduous trek across Mexico before she reached the lazy river that divides Mexico from the United States and is the last physical obstacle to what migrants all hope is a better life in the north.Claudia’s goal, according to her father, Gilberto Gómez, was to find a job in the United States and become an accountant. She came from the village of La Unión Los Mendoza in the municipality of San Juan Ostuncalco, a largely indigenous community where most people speak the Mayan language Mam. Sending her to school had been a financial struggle; continuing on to the university would have cost even more and was out of the question. That realization pushed Claudia to consider going to the United States. “Now all I can hope for is getting justice for my daughter,” her father told BuzzFeed News.Verónica G. Cárdenas for BuzzFeed News Marta Martínez on her front porch.Marta Martínez is no stranger to recording border agents or police activity near her house, which sits less than half a mile from the Rio Grande. She admits she lives with her phone in her hand.Martínez said she didn’t hear any shouts or orders from Border Patrol officers before she heard the single shot that hot, sunny day in May. Claudia had fallen dead just feet from her bathroom window. Martínez said she started following the shouts of Border Patrol agents, recording as she ducked behind the cars parked in her driveway. “I wasn’t scared at the moment because I didn’t expect to see what I saw,” Martínez said in Spanish. “I thought he had fired up into the air.” In an unpublished video viewed by BuzzFeed News, the sounds of ambulance sirens and crackling Border Patrol radios get louder as Martínez walks closer to the back of the empty lot, which is overrun by brush and trash. “Come over here,” a Border Patrol agent can be heard saying in a mix of English and Spanish to a migrant man, one of the people Claudia had been with. “Come with me... What’s your friend’s name?” As the border agent takes the man into custody and walks him toward the street, he points in Martínez’s direction and tells another agent that there are two more migrants on her property. They were hiding inside a dark and crumbling trailer home that occupies a spot on the lot. Moments later, Martínez’s camera points to Claudia’s motionless body. She’s facedown in the brush near the chain-link fence that divides the two properties. “Hey, we don’t want footage in there,” an agent tells Martínez. “Why did you guys shoot him?” Martínez says, ignoring the agent. “Hey, no, please, don’t get into this,” the Border Patrol agent says. Martínez stays near the fence and continues to record. Claudia’s head is pointing to one of the front corners of the property, and her feet are near the fence. When the agent flips Claudia’s body over, the video captures Martínez’s horrified gasp. Blood covers the woman’s face. Martínez said that’s when she realized how young Claudia was. “Oh my god, she's a girl, and you guys shoot her in the face,” Martínez says to the agents, her voice rising with shock. That’s when Martínez went live on Facebook and started to follow the Border Patrol agents around her property as they detained two more migrant men. She asks repeatedly why the agents shot the young woman. At times, her tone is scolding. “Why did you kill that woman? You killed her!” Martínez is heard saying to the agents. “I saw you with the gun.” Later that day, CBP put out its first version of what had happened. In a statement, it said a lone Border Patrol agent had discovered a group of migrant people near a culvert. “Initial reports indicate that as the agent attempted to apprehend the group, he came under attack by multiple subjects using blunt objects,” the statement said, describing Claudia as “one of the assailants.” The agent, the statement said, then fired at least one shot and killed Claudia. Two days later, CBP issued another statement, this time omitting any mention of blunt objects. It said a 15-year veteran of the Border Patrol had been “allegedly assaulted” and “rushed.” “According to the agent, the group ignored his verbal commands [to get on the ground] and instead rushed him,” the statement read. Martínez’s unpublished video, which she’s turned over to the FBI, challenges those accounts. For one, several agents are visible, though whether they arrived before or after the shooting isn’t apparent. For another, Claudia’s body is in the bushes near the fence that separates the empty lot from Martínez’s. Martínez thinks Claudia probably was hiding. “It really angers and saddens me at the same time,” Martínez said. George Altgelt, the attorney for the Border Patrol agent and a city council member in nearby Laredo, declined to go into specifics but said his client was innocent of any wrongdoing. “A tragedy occurred, albeit not at the hands of my client,” Altgelt told BuzzFeed News. “We look forward to the government asking the really tough questions as to the real culprit of this tragedy.” In addition to the FBI and Texas Rangers, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is looking into the shooting, Altgelt said. The Department of Justice said it does not confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations. As part of the federal inquiry into the shooting, hours after the incident, an officer with the Webb County District Attorney’s Office searched the lot, recovering, according to a copy of a search warrant obtained by BuzzFeed News, four “long sticks,” a black and gray coat, an ID, a cellphone, and Claudia’s body.The search warrant contradicts CBP’s initial statement about a lone agent cornering a group of people, stating that “agents” had chased a group of migrants into the empty lot, which had cinderblock walls at the front and back. Michael Wu, the officer who executed the warrant, was told by an FBI agent at the scene that the agent who shot Claudia had been attacked with a stick and fired the bullet in self-defense, according to the warrant. Wu declined to answer questions when contacted by BuzzFeed News. “It’s a way dangerous situation crossing the US–Mexico border illegally. It’s also a very dangerous job being a US Border Patrol agent,” Altgelt said. “Our hearts go out to the young lady and her family. We’re looking forward to the full investigation of this case and the clearing of my client’s good name” — which has been circulating at protests over the shooting, though not officially released.Veronica G. Cardenas Attendees of Claudia Patricia Gómez González’s vigil hold signs in Spanish that read, “We are Claudia” while they pose for a photo.With about 60,000 employees, a 2017 budget of $14.4 billion, and jurisdiction up to 100 miles from US borders (though agents can make arrests anywhere in the country), CBP is the nation’s largest law enforcement agency. Its Border Patrol division employs more than 19,000 agents alone with a budget of about $3.8 billion.While a local police shooting draws massive attention, with police departments often quickly divulging the name of the officer involved, little information comes out about incidents involving the Border Patrol. Claudia’s was the third shooting death this year involving Border Patrol agents, but the only one that seemingly took place in the line of duty. The Southern Border Communities Coalition, a group of more than 60 organizations from San Diego, California, to Brownsville, Texas, has tracked 77 deaths caused by border agents since 2010. Even when the families of people killed by Border Patrol agents sue the government, CBP fights to keep the name of agents secret. In a lawsuit filed by the family of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, an undocumented immigrant who died in 2010 of a heart attack after a CBP agent shocked him with a Taser, attorneys for the government asked for a protective order to keep the identity of the federal agents involved secret. The judge agreed but later lifted the protective order in 2013 for all but one of the agents. The following year, Border Patrol Agent Gabriel Ducoing was named in the lawsuit. Joanna Williams, director of education and advocacy at the Kino Border Initiative, a binational organization along the US–Mexico border that works with migrants in the twin cities of Nogales, says it’s no surprise that such incidents get little attention. “Many of these [shootings] are out in rural areas where the only witnesses are Border Patrol and migrants who end up getting deported,” she said. An exception was the killing of a Mexican teenager in downtown Nogales in 2012 by a Border Patrol agent who was standing behind the border fence on the US side and fired down into the busy Mexican side. Sixteen-year-old José Antonio Elena Rodríguez was hit at least 10 times, with most of the bullets striking him in the back. Not only were there witnesses, but Border Patrol surveillance footage from cameras nearby captured the events. The agent, Lonnie Swartz, was charged with second-degree murder in the case, though a jury acquitted him of that charge in April of this year. Swartz said he shot the 16-year-old while defending himself from drug smugglers who were throwing rocks at him. Prosecutors said that Elena Rodríguez was throwing rocks but did not deserve to die. The jury deadlocked on lesser charges of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and a retrial is expected to take place in October. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that Elena Rodríguez’s mother was entitled to sue Swartz for damages over her son’s death. On June 28, 36 days after Claudia was killed and at the height of outrage over family separations at the border, an advocacy group in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley called La Unión del Pueblo Entero (LUPE), which translates to the Union of the Entire People, organized a vigil to bring attention to the shooting. A framed picture of Claudia was displayed above an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, both women surrounded by flickering candles and flowers. Attendees who gathered on the hot Texas evening held signs that said “Remember her name” and “We’re Claudia.” About 50 people showed up. Agripina Gómez, a community organizer with LUPE who is not related to Claudia, has been in contact with her parents in Guatemala. “Last time I spoke to them they asked me ‘What’s going to happen to him? Do you know if there’s going to be any justice for my little girl?” Gómez told BuzzFeed News. “I don’t think they believe there will be justice.”Guillermo Arias / AFP / Getty Images A portrait of José Antonio Elena Rodríguez on the US–Mexico border fence in Nogales.Partly because of the Elena Rodríguez shooting, CBP’s use-of-force policies came under harsh scrutiny, and in 2014, the then-head of the agency, Gil Kerlikowske, ordered a revision of the agency’s use-of-force guidelines. The new policies discouraged agents from using lethal force in response to rock throwers, unless they have a “reasonable belief” that they’re in imminent danger of serious injury or death. He also set up a formal review process for use-of-force incidents and pushed the agency to release information on shootings soon after they occur. He told Congress in 2015 that the rush to double the number of Border Patrol agents after the 9/11 terrorist attacks had allowed bad actors to join its ranks. “When we lowered our standards of hiring and did not properly vet people, we made mistakes in who got hired. And we paid a price for that and are continuing to pay a price for that,” Kerlikowske told the House of Representatives’ Appropriations Committee at the time. Today, Kerlikowske says he still favors transparency. But he draws the line at releasing the names of agents involved in shooting incidents. A former police chief in Seattle, he noted that no other federal law enforcement agency does so. Kerlikowske said the reason for a difference between how federal and local officials deal with such information is a matter of their different constituencies. Local police are much more transparent because they report to locally elected officials and depend on good relations with their communities to fulfill their law enforcement responsibilities. “You don’t have an elected community council or mayor,” Kerlikowske told BuzzFeed News. “Federal agencies don’t have that level of interaction and really dependency at the local level.” There’s another reason border shootings don’t gain much attention, says Aaron Fountain, a historian of youth activism at Indiana University: Latinos, as a whole, don’t see themselves as affected by border violence. For US-born Latinos, crossing the border isn’t part of their experience. The same goes for Latinos from the Caribbean, who don’t deal with border crossing, Fountain said. On the other hand, black people, whose deaths in disproportionate numbers at the hands of police have become a divisive issue in the United States, share a common sense of oppression. “It doesn’t matter how rich or educated you are, because of your blackness, you have a lot in common with the poorest person,” Fountain said. “You’re facing discrimination, getting pulled over by the cops — stuff that crosses socioeconomic lines.” It’s difficult to deny the role of pressure in forcing authorities to release the details of police-involved shootings. Shortly after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, the police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to name the officer who shot the 18-year-old, saying the then-unidentified officer needed protection after multiple death threats. It was only after days of protests and clashes with police that Darren Wilson was named as the shooter. In the recent July 14 shooting of Harith Augustus by Chicago police, the police department released an edited video of police camera footage in an effort to quell tensions following protests, though the officers involved in the incident have not been identified. Police shootings rarely draw mass protests from Latinos, however, especially not along the border. “Latinos have a history of fighting for rights as citizens and noncitizens, but that is historical context missing from the larger discussion of immigration,” Fountain said.Veronica G.

Some of the parents who signed the forms were seeking asylum.“This really is the systemic and intentional effort to take children away from parents and hold them as hostages in order to sabotage their right to apply for asylum in the US and then use these children as threats to other parents contemplating coming to the United States,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.Asked about the complaint, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, referred to the July 31 Senate testimony of Matt Albence, an executive associate director at ICE, who denied that ICE officers were coercing parents to be deported.“There is long-standing ICE policy which dictates how a reunification may occur for an individual that is being detained and going through an immigration process,” Albence said.More than 2,500 children were separated from their parents as a result of the zero tolerance policy, which sought to prosecute anyone caught trying to enter the US illegally. Being prosecuted for illegal entry resulted in parents being sent to federal custody to face the charges and their children being sent into the custody of Health and Human Services.Following immense outcry, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to keep detained families together. As a result of a lawsuit over family separations, a federal judge also ordered the government to reunite the separated families, though 366 parents had already been deported without their kids, and 565 children remain in government custody without their parents.The complaint was submitted to DHS’s Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and Inspector General.A mother from Guatemala who was separated from her 5-year-old son for 32 days told lawyers that she was told to sign a form by an ICE officer who said, “Sign here [and] you will get your child back if you return to your country,” without being told there were other options, such as being reunited with her son and allowed to stay in the US to fight their asylum case.“I was so desperate to know the whereabouts of my son and finally hold him in my arms again that I signed for both of us to be reunited even if it meant going back to Guatemala,” said the mother, identified as A.E. in the complaint.In the El Paso area, numerous parents said that ICE officers demanded that they sign forms affirmatively abandoning their rights to reunification. Fathers at the West Texas Detention Facility in Sierra Blanca, Texas, said they were forced to sign forms waiving reunification and were not told they were entitled to pursue their asylum claims and be reunited with their child, the complaint said.Four parents, who had recently been reunited with their children, said that on July 25, ICE officers boarded the bus they were on and told her to sign pre-completed forms saying they wanted to be deported with their kids. At least two fathers refused to sign, saying they wanted to be deported without their children. They were yelled at in English and pressured in Spanish to sign the forms.“All four fathers recounted that their children were separated from them a second time upon their refusal to sign the forms pre-marked with Option 1, which would have agreed to them being deported together,” the complaint said.Katie Shepherd, the national advocacy counsel for the Immigration Justice Campaign, said many parents reported being given inadequate or spoiled food and forced to lie on cold floors while being held at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, creating a stressful and coercive environment.“The coercion and coercive environment created by government officials really started at the moment these families entered US soil,” Shepherd said on a call with reporters.Among several corrective actions the complaint seeks, advocates for the families want DHS to announce a clear policy forbidding any tactics that pressure people into making decisions affecting their legal cases. The complaint also says DHS should bring back deported parents who were not given the chance to reunite with their children or “meaningfully participate” in the asylum process."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/23/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-16197-1535048082-1.jpg?crop=1484:776;0,2137d1a015c77724d15abae776d8405034c	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Immigrant Fathers Who Were Detained By ICE Were Separated From Their Children Again	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Immigrant Fathers Who Were Detained By ICE Were Separated From Their Children Again	0	"The separation of 16 fathers and their sons for the second time by immigration authorities has attorneys concerned that their clients' latest split from their children is an attempt to quell protests inside the Texas detention facility.The reseparations on Wednesday took place a day before at least 30 dads held at the Karnes County Residential Center, in Karnes City, Texas, were planning to go on a hunger strike and two weeks after a larger group of fathers said they would do the same in an attempt to press US authorities to expedite their cases. Their sons were going to go on a strike of their own by refusing to participate in any school activities.Casey Miller, a legal assistant with the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said the second separations were not only traumatic for the families but appeared to be an intimidation tactic by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop the dads from going on a hunger strike this week.""It's super calculated by ICE,"" Miller told BuzzFeed News. ""It feels like a game, like 'We're going to beat you at your own game because we have all of the money and power.'""The fathers and kids were not given any information when they were separated about when they would see each other again, but they were reunited the next day.This group of fathers was among the more than 2,500 parents who were separated from their kids after they were caught crossing the border illegally under the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy. A judge has since forced the government to reunite the families, but these fathers have grown increasingly frustrated at being detained without any information about when they will be released.The separations on Wednesday occurred at about noon, Miller said. ICE officers inside the Karnes County detention center wearing tactical gear handcuffed and took the 16 fathers to the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall, Texas, while their kids were in school. Some of the fathers said they were in their cells when ICE agents arrived, asked for them by name, and then took them out.Their sons were then placed in two separate rooms in a medical area, with eight boys in each room.Attorneys, legal assistants, and volunteers with RAICES who were meeting with some of the fathers said they were hurriedly evacuated from Karnes and also saw armed ICE officers in the hallways as they were leaving.In a statement, ICE said that on Wednesday about 40 men detained at Karnes were involved in a disturbance, and that as a result they deployed additional officers and asked all visitors to leave the facility. The agency said no kids were involved in the incident and also declined to go into detail about what the disturbance was.""No one was injured during this incident,"" ICE said.Miller said around nine of the 16 fathers were part of the group who had planned to go on a hunger strike previously. She suspects ICE did not exclusively single out fathers who had organized so it wouldn't appear they were being targeted.""It still had the effect of intimidating, retaliation,"" Miller said.Ryan Clough, a staff attorney with RAICES, said that when he asked an ICE officer to provide examples of the disturbance they said it included behavior such as not wanting to eat with their kids, not taking the children to school inside the facility, and not ""going with the flow."" Clough said many of the 16 dads were in their rooms at the time they were taken away in handcuffs and not causing a disturbance.""The facts strongly suggest this was retaliation for a lawful peaceful protest,"" Clough said.In a phone call with reporters, some of the fathers said they were put in solitary confinement, or ""the hole,"" when they arrived at the South Texas Detention Complex. The dads weren't given any information as to where their sons were or when they would see them. Their kids were also not given any information.""We started to die again, now knowing anything about our sons,"" said one father from Honduras who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. ""They did the same thing the first time when they separated us from our kids.""Another father, also from Honduras, said he couldn't wrap his head around what was happening to him.""It seemed like they were going to take away my son,"" he said in Spanish. ""It was hard not knowing anything, what they had done with him.""A boy from Honduras said he was taken by a woman to a room with the other boys. He said they weren't told what happened to their fathers.""I was crying for my daddy,"" the boy said. ""I spent the entire time crying. I wanted to see my dad.""The hunger strike that was being planned, as well as the earlier one, stemmed from the fathers' frustration over being detained by ICE without any indication of when they would be released. There were conflicting reports from RAICES and ICE about whether a hunger strike had occurred on Aug. 2, but federal authorities did say there was a “brief sit-in” over frustrations about the fathers' immigration cases.The issue of when they will be released is being debated in federal court. Judges have been looking into whether to deport the reunited families after lawyers expressed concern that parents reported being coerced into choosing between being deported without their kids or being deported with them and having the minors' immigration cases dropped.On Thursday, San Diego Judge Dana Sabraw, who is also overseeing the lawsuit that forced the government to reunite families, ordered the government to temporarily halt the deportation of children who had been separated by the Trump administration in order to give time to pursue any asylum cases. The families will have to wait at least another week while the government and attorneys come up with a plan that will allow the kids to pursue their claims without being deported."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-27915-1534638960-1.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,11573b72161d9ec4ed4bdac1a186de1e003	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		Court Says Mexican Mother Can Sue US Agent Who Killed Her Son In Cross-Border Shooting	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	Court Says Mexican Mother Can Sue US Agent Who Killed Her Son In Cross-Border Shooting	0	"The likeness of Jose Antonio Elena Rodríguez hangs next to a makeshift memorial where he was fatally shot by a US Border Patrol agent near the US–Mexico borderA federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the mother of a Mexican teenager killed in a cross-border shooting by a US Border Patrol agent can sue for damages.The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said agent Lonnie Swartz can be sued for violating the Fourth Amendment and was not immune from such a suit.The case stems from the 2012 shooting of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodríguez, who was shot, primarily in the back, by about 10 bullets while walking parallel to the border in Nogales, Mexico, according to the ruling.""The mother of the boy who was killed has a cause of action against the agent for money damages,"" Judge Andrew J.

The policy called for charging every person caught crossing the border with illegal entry.The move resulted in the systematic separation of children from their parents because the kids couldn't go with them to federal custody while they waited to see a judge for the federal misdemeanor illegal entry charge.Following intense backlash over the practice, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on June 20 ending the practice for parents with kids, though the policy remains in place. Sabraw later ordered the government to reunite the families as part of a lawsuit brought by the ACLU over family separations.Sabraw also said it was ""unacceptable"" that there was no plan on the government's end to locate and reunite the deported parents of 410 kids currently in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement or the parents of 68 children released into the US.He called for the government to appoint one or two people from the State Department or Department of Health and Human Services to take responsibility for locating the parents and said he would issue an order spelling out what the government is to do.

Family separations, the administration said, were simply a consequence of prosecuting all immigrants who were caught trying to enter the US illegally.But an analysis of prosecutions during the weeks after Sessions announced the policy found that during May, US border authorities chose to prosecute adults with kids over adults crossing the border by themselves. That same analysis — by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University — found that only 32% of all adult immigrants caught crossing the border were charged with entering the US illegally that month — an indication that it wasn’t a blanket policy but a targeted effort directed at parents with kids.In May, weeks after the formal announcement of the policy, US border authorities apprehended 4,458 adults with children, the analysis found, while it arrested 24,465 adults without children. Yet only 9,216 adults were referred for prosecution, far fewer than the number of adults who in theory should have been referred under ""zero tolerance.""Since fewer than one out of three adults detained at the southwest border in May were referred for prosecution, US Customs and Border Protection clearly was choosing to prosecute parents while electing not to prosecute adults without kids, the analysis concluded.""The Administration has not explained its rationale for prosecuting parents with children when that left so many other adults without children who were not being referred for prosecution,"" the report said.Susan B. Long, codirector of TRAC and an associate professor of managerial statistics at the Martin J. Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, said researchers don't yet have data on how many adults with kids were prosecuted or how many single adults faced charges in May.Still, she said, it's clear the administration made the decision to prosecute some parents over single adults.""It wasn't like [the prosecutions] were automatic; this was a conscious choice,"" Long said. ""We have yet to know the number of separations due to them being criminally prosecuted.""The data in another TRAC report showed that only one adult with children was referred for criminal prosecution in April, Long said. That surprised researchers because the ""zero tolerance"" policy that the administration said forced it to prosecute parents and separate them from their kids was announced April 6.""We looked really hard for things to suggest data is unreliable or make you doubt it,"" Long told BuzzFeed News. ""We were so shocked. The Border Patrol data indicated they referred only one parent, and there were lots of separations.""A separate TRAC report found that 1,060 out of 4,537 adults arrested by border authorities in April were deported. At the same time, only 851 children out of the 5,144 arrested as part of family units were deported — meaning hundreds of parents appear to have been deported without their kids, the report said.Overall, criminal prosecutions of adults referred by CBP increased by 918 from April to May, from 8,298 to 9,216.Nearly 3,000 immigrant children ended up being separated from their parents as a result of the administration's policy. More than a quarter of those kids remain separated from their parents, despite a court's order to the administration that they be reunited by last week.In a statement, CBP said it ""strongly"" disagreed with the TRAC analysis because no one was exempt from being referred for prosecution for illegal entry, including adults with kids who cross the US border.""The number of referrals and types of referrals made are based on a variety of issues, none of which includes the choice to refer solely based on the fact an adult has a child,"" the CBP statement said.About 85% of people prosecuted for illegal entry between May 5 and June 20 were single adults, the CBP statement said.But the ""zero tolerance"" policy was announced on April 6 and separations were occurring weeks before the May 5 date CBP pointed to. Even though the ""zero tolerance"" policy ramped up in May, there were still family separations occurring in April. The Department of Homeland Security originally told reporters that from April 19 to May 31 some 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 adults.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in June suspending prosecution referrals of adults traveling with their children. Still, the ""zero tolerance"" policy remains in place, and there are other reasons why parents could be separated from kids at the border, such as criminal history, presenting a danger to the child, or fraudulent claims of guardianship."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/1/11/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-8390-1533136204-7.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,23051d83468e3c04abe8f81472d5a6693ee	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		500 Fathers And Their Kids Declare A Strike At An Immigrant Detention Center In Texas	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	500 Fathers And Their Kids Declare A Strike At An Immigrant Detention Center In Texas	0	"A group of 500 fathers detained with their sons at an immigration detention facility in Texas were set to begin a hunger strike Wednesday while their children were to begin a protest of their own, refusing to participate in any school activities.Organizers of the protest, in statements distributed by the advocacy group RAICES, said that the fathers and their sons, who are being held at the Karnes Detention Center, in Karnes City, Texas, agreed to the strike to press US authorities to expedite their cases. The fathers were separated from their sons at the border under the Trump administration's “zero tolerance” policy, then reunited with their children, and are now being detained with no idea of when they might be released.One of the statements came from a Honduran father who identified himself as Jorge. He said he’d been separated from his son May 12, has since been reunited, and had been at the detention facility for 10 days but has been told nothing about his case. He said others have been there for up to 20 days with no information on their cases.“The children no longer want to be here, detained,” Jorge said in the statement, which was distributed as both a recording and a transcript. “We can’t stand it anymore. We are desperate. They should just do what they need to do, whether it is to deport us or allow us to be free to work with visas.”Representatives of RAICES, which stands for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said they’d interviewed some of the fathers planning to participate in the strike, but that they could not say if the strike had begun or how it had affected detention center operations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which operates the center, did not respond to a request for comment.RAICES said the fathers said they planned to place themselves in the detention center’s three patio areas and refuse to eat. Their sons were expected to refuse to participate in school activities.Manoj Govindaiah, RAICES’ director of family detention services, said the mood inside Karnes is the tensest he’s seen in 12 years of practicing immigration law.“The trauma caused by their separations has forced these fathers into untenable positions of fear, anger, and despair,” Govindaiah said. “That these families feel the need to strike shows how tired they are of the games the administration continues to play.”In a statement ICE said there was no mass protest or hunger strike by residents at Karnes. It was a brief sit-in, the agency said.""A small group of fathers and their children (fewer than 50 total) staged a brief sit-in and expressed their concerns about their immigration cases,"" ICE said. ""The on-site ICE supervisor thoroughly explained the process; the residents appreciated the information and dispersed. In addition, there were no unusual absences from school at Karnes.""Jennifer Falcon, a spokesperson for RAICES, said the detained fathers and sons are not being treated with dignity and care.""Karnes staff has a history of abuses of power. This includes the last time a hunger strike happened, in which ICE held a meeting to let the mothers know if they continue to refuse to eat they would be classified as security risks or 'unavailable' to care for their children and therefore separated from them,” Falcon said in a statement.RAICES said its attorneys suspect that many of the fathers at Karnes were coerced into agreeing to deportation in order to expedite reunification with their children. Now that they’ve been reunited and have access to legal advice, they’ve learned they have potential asylum claims that they want to pursue rather than be deported.Jorge said in his statement that ICE officials told him that when he was brought to Karnes he would be able to meet with an asylum official.“I have not met with anyone. We did not commit a crime,” Jorge said. “The only offense is that we crossed the border, and in my case, I’ve already been sent to a federal prison for that.”Another father who declined to give his name said in his statement that his 6-year-old son doesn’t want to eat and keeps asking him why they are incarcerated at Karnes.“My son cries every day, he doesn’t want to eat, he’s very worried and he’s only 6 years old,” the father said. “What worries me is that we are restrained from our freedom as human beings. Our children are crying.”The father said he has a partner and daughter who depend on him back home, which is why he wants a response from US officials on what will happen to him and his son.“Either I will be deported or be granted an opportunity to stay in this country,” the father said. “We are not criminals, we are not people who come to this country to harm others. We are decent people who only come for a better life, people who travel to this country in search to help our loved ones back home. Help us.”The Karnes Detention Center is one of three family detention centers overseen by ICE. GEO Group, a private contractor that operates the facility for ICE, on its site says it has capacity for 1,158.However, a Department of Homeland Security audit from 2017 said that that number was reduced to 830 beds due to Texas Department of Family and Protective Services guidelines allowing only five beds per residential suite. There are 166 residential suites inside the Karnes City facility. The US government has the capacity to hold 3,326 people in its three family immigration detention centers, according to an April Government Accountability Office report."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-08/3/2/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/500-fathers-and-their-kids-declare-a-strike-at-an-2-25613-1533276697-0_dblbig.jpgb21681df4d1e427e9ee420824bc56aae	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		1,820 Children Were Reunited With Their Parents. But That's Not The End Of The Story.	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	1,820 Children Were Reunited With Their Parents. But That's Not The End Of The Story.	0	"The parents of as many as 468 children, who were separated from their mothers and fathers at the border, were deported by the Trump administration, according to statistics made public in a San Diego court hearing, and now US authorities must figure out how to reunite them — or whether to reunite them at all.Authorities also must find the parents of 43 children who apparently were released into the United States, but whose whereabouts the government has lost track of —more testimony to the lack of record-keeping that has plagued the Trump administration's family separation crisis from the beginning.Those numbers were made public in court on Friday at a hearing in San Diego where the government declared that it had successfully reunited 1,820 families by the court's July 26 deadline. Most of them were then allowed to go free in the US — an ironic conclusion to two months of chaos caused by the administration’s efforts to prevent that very outcome.Deputy Assistant Attorney General Scott Stewart told the court that the number of parents outside of the US doesn't necessarily include only those who were deported without their kids. But his answer also was a reminder that US officials simply don't know; Stewart at first used the number 431 for how many children had parents who were outside the US; later in the hearing, he said the number had risen to 468.""We are still getting more granularity there,"" Stewart said.US officials offered no explanation for the higher figure. How those parents and children will be reunited remained uncertain.According to court documents filed Thursday in San Diego federal court, the Trump administration reunited 1,442 families where a parent was still in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Another 378 children were either reunited with a parent who already had been released in the United States, placed with a sponsor, reunified with a parent in custody earlier in the process, or had turned 18 and were no longer minors, according to the documents.Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney for the parents and deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, which sued the federal government to force the reunification of parents and children who'd been separated from one another at the US border, declined to comment on the number of kids whose parents were outside the United States.He said he was ""thrilled"" for immigrant families that had been reunited by the deadline. Still, in court he chastised the government for not giving the ACLU enough information to track down deported parents.""We are just asking for as much information as possible. Unless the government is going to tell us, 'We will find all 400-plus of those parents,' it is going to fall on the NGOs,"" Gelernt said. ""So we just need every bit of information they can give us. And we will take it on a rolling basis, but we would just start — we would just want to start looking.""Stewart said the government had already given the ACLU a ""fulsome"" list of the deported parents, including their names, the dates on which they had been arrested trying to enter the country, the dates on which they were removed from the United States, and the country they were returned to.""I am going to stand very firm that the government has worked very, very hard and put in tremendous hours to give Mr. Gelernt the information that he says he does not have,"" Stewart said.Gelernt said he also wanted any contact information the government has, any notes they took, and anything else that could help track down deported parents. Ultimately, US District Judge Dana Sabraw, who is hearing the case, said he will issue an order setting out additional information the plaintiffs are entitled to.Sabraw commended the government for reunifying 1,820 children with their parents.""The government deserves great credit in that regard,"" Sabraw said. ""The government is at fault for losing several hundred parents in the process, and that's where we have to go next.""Sabraw also told the government that it must come up with a procedure to make certain the confusion of the last two months doesn't happen again. He noted that immigrants will continue to try to enter the United States.""This problem cannot repeat,"" Sabraw said."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/27/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/sub-buzz-5316-1532734204-5.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230fcbaa41469a54e4a9c20571ce006d30d	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		"Separated Parents Were ""Totally Unaware"" They Had Waived Their Right To Be Reunified With Their Children"	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	"Separated Parents Were ""Totally Unaware"" They Had Waived Their Right To Be Reunified With Their Children"	0	"Immigrant parents who were separated from their children at the border told attorneys they were misinformed, coerced, or tricked into waiving their rights to be reunified with their kids.In court documents filed in San Diego on Wednesday, a father from Guatemala said immigration officials told him he was definitely going to be deported and asked if he wanted to be deported with his daughter or by himself. They did not ask him if he wanted to be reunited with his daughter in the US.Without an opportunity to review the document, he signed a form that officials told him was the only way his daughter could stay in the United States, according to a declaration signed by attorney Sofia Reive.""He told me it is not safe for his daughter to return to Guatemala due to extreme and specific threats from a powerful and dangerous man who has demanded to 'buy' her,"" Reive said. ""He signed the document because he felt pressured to do so and because he felt like he had no other choice. This entire interaction lasted approximately one minute.""The declarations from attorneys working with detained parents who were separated from their kids describe people who don't speak English being pressured into signing documents; being forced to make a decision in a room full of dozens of people with only a few minutes to decide whether to leave their kids in the US; or incorrectly believing they were signing a form that would reunite them with their children.The testimonials were offered in support of a motion being considered by US District Judge Dana Sabraw on whether to stop the federal government from deporting parents until seven days after they have been reunited with their kids. The American Civil Liberties Union has argued that deporting parents and kids immediately after they are reunited doesn't give the family enough time to decide what is best for the child, such as continuing to fight their case in the US or returning to their home country with their parent.In Wednesday's filing, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said parents aren't being allowed to make informed decisions with deep consequences before seeing their children or having enough time to do so. As it is, some parents quickly signed away their chances to be reunified with their kids without legal advice, time to think, or translation, Gelernt said.Some 85 parents purportedly signed a form waiving reunification, and 127 waived it orally, Gelernt said."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/25/20/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/separated-parents-were-totally-unaware-they-had-w-2-19316-1532564202-1_dblbig.jpga1b4afc2e1334e0e86a04a3891dbb9e5	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		“I Feel Like I Am Trash”: Immigrant Children Describe Squalid Conditions In Detention Centers Along The US Border	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	“I Feel Like I Am Trash”: Immigrant Children Describe Squalid Conditions In Detention Centers Along The US Border	0	"In interviews filed in federal court this week, immigrant parents and children say they were held for days in frigid, filthy cells and cages at facilities run by US Customs and Border Protection.Jose Luis Gonzalez / Reuters Salvadoran immigrants outside the House of the Migrant shelter.Immigrant children and their families apprehended at the southern border in recent months described in court filings being held for days in squalid, freezing detention facilities, where they were often given spoiled food and unclean drinking water, and were left in a state of confusion about what — if any — future they would have in the US. Keylin, a 16-year-old from Honduras, said that she and her mother were detained at Customs and Border Protection facilities in Texas. Despite arriving “muddy and wet,” having crossed the border at the Rio Grande river, she said they were not allowed to shower or change for several days. Separated from her mother in a facility known as the “Dog Pound,” she said that she was put in a cell with other teenage girls. “The female guards yelled at me and the other girls a lot. They called us names and made fun of us,” she said in an interview filed in a federal court in Los Angeles this week. “I was very frightened and depressed the entire time. I was scared of the guards and scared I would be deported without my mother.” Dixiana, a 10-year-old from Honduras who also crossed the border with her mother in Texas, similarly described being separated from her parent and given food that seemed spoiled. “They gave me a frozen ham sandwich. The ham was black. I took one bite but did not eat the rest,” she said through a translator. And Sergio, a 17-year-old from Guatemala housed in Casa Padre — the largest facility for immigrant children, run by Southwest Key in McAllen, Texas — told interviewers that he and his father were separated shortly after presenting themselves at the border, and taken to different detention centers. His father, he said, now faces deportation. “When I left, and my dad wasn’t with me, they told me not to worry, that he would be coming in a moment,” he said. “I went in the car and felt very relieved and happy that he would follow. But it wasn’t like that. He didn’t come. I haven’t seen him since then.” “I do not want to be here anymore, especially since I know how much my father is suffering. The way I have been treated makes me feel like I don’t matter, like I am trash,” he said. The statements are part of a new cache of testimonies from immigrant children and parents filed in the court this week as part of a long-running lawsuit that resulted in the 1997 Flores settlement, which dictates the treatment of minors in immigrant detention facilities. Lawyers at the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, which is representing the immigrants, said these interviews are evidence that the government is violating the terms of that settlement. They have asked the court to appoint a special monitor to oversee the network of detention facilities that house children and families across the US. Volunteers for the Los Angeles–based group interviewed more than 200 immigrants at eight CBP facilities along the US–Mexico border, as well as at the three family detention centers run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a shelter for unaccompanied minors in Brownsville, Texas. The statements, taken between June and July of this year, provide an often damning account of life for immigrants detained under the “zero tolerance” policy implemented by the Trump administration this spring that separated children from their families. “It amounts to a picture not just of forcibly separating thousands of children from their parents, but on a much broader level of a program of forced hunger, forced thirst, forced sleep deprivation, coupled with routine insults, threats, and physical assault, that leave class member children crying, trembling, hungry, thirsty, sleepless, sick, and terrified,” Center for Human Rights attorney Peter Schey wrote in a declaration describing the testimonies. “Mental health experts agree that many class members will never fully recover from the terror and humiliation they experienced” in custody, he added.CBP's Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP People who've been taken into custody related to cases of illegal entry into the United States, at a facility in McAllen, Texas.The accounts are remarkable both in their volume and in their consistency — there are 223 in total. At CBP facilities in Texas, Arizona, and California, immigrants described being separated from their relatives, and held in cold, crowded cells and cages with limited sleeping mats and drinking water. In many cases, immigrants said they were not allowed to shower and were not given a change of clothes. They said they were deprived of sleep by guards who would kick their feet and leave the lights on at night.Timofei, a 10-year-old Jehovah’s Witness from Russia, who said he and his parents were escaping religious persecution there, described being held in a crowded room with other teenage boys after being detained by CBP in California. “My body hurts because we have to sleep on hard mats,” he said. “All day we are in a locked room,” Timofei added. “I have not seen sunlight since I have been staying in the camp.” Ventura, who was held with her 6-year-old daughter at a CBP site in Yuma, Arizona, said the only water she received was from the bathroom sink, which she drank with her hands because detainees were not given cups. The 21-year-old said the cup of noodles the immigrants were given don’t fully cook because the water is not warm enough. The mother and daughter weren’t given any pillows or mattresses and were forced to sleep on the cold floor. “It’s loud because kids are crying because of cold,” Ventura said. Sachin, a 17-year-old from India who was apprehended June 14 after climbing over the border wall in California and interviewed at a CBP facility there, said he still had not been able to bathe or brush his teeth the following day. “I really want to take a shower, but I don’t know how to ask,” he said. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, CBP declined to comment on the filings. “As a matter of policy, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not comment on pending litigation,"" CBP spokesperson Daniel Hetlage said. “However, lack of comment should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations. CBP takes all allegations seriously, and investigates all formal complaints.”Asked to comment on the interviews, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice referred BuzzFeed News to a report filed by the government in the Flores case last month, in which CBP’s juvenile coordinator Henry Moak Jr. assured the court that the government was meeting the standards laid out in the settlement agreement.The government makes an extensive effort “to ensure all minors in CBP custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors,” Moak wrote. He said that parents and children he had interviewed in CBP custody told him they had “received meals and snacks; had access to drinking water, functioning toilets, and functioning sinks; and were held in rooms that were maintained at an appropriate temperature.” Moak added that he even drank the water from containers at processing centers in McAllen and Yuma and found it was clean. However, Delmis, who said she was detained at Texas facilities with her 9-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son after fleeing Honduras, said, “The worst thing was the water.” “I had to plug my nose to be able to drink it. It came out of the faucet and smelled terrible,” Delmis added.CBP's Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP Children who've been taken into custody related to cases of illegal entry into the United States, at a facility in McAllen, Texas.In McAllen — where a majority of family separations have taken place — dozens of immigrants described the grim treatment at two CBP facilities known as the “Ice Box” and the “Dog Pound.”Lidia, a 22-year-old citizen of El Salvador who crossed the border in Texas with her 4-year-old son, told an interviewer that the two of them “went hungry the entire time” during their stay at the two facilities last month. “The only food we were given were sandwiches that were frozen and not able to be eaten.” The “Dog Pound” — so named because of the cages that immigrants are detained in — “was so overcrowded that we could not stand or walk around,” Lidia said, adding that, while at the facility, she contracted a urinary tract infection, which has since developed into a kidney infection. Guards at the facility “were yelling at the mothers separated from their children not to look at their children in the separate cages,” she added. “The female guards told the mothers and children that they would be punished for looking at each other.” Some immigrants also detailed verbal, and in some cases physical, abuse. And their interviews underscored the emotional toll that family separations and detention have had on children taken into custody.Angel, a 13-year-old from Mexico, said that he was separated from his mother at CBP facilities in McAllen, where “the guards told the boys in my cell that they were going to be adopted and that they would never see their parents again, that were the property of the United States because we were on their territory.” “The atmosphere in the cell was really hard,” Angel said. “The children would cry constantly. Sometimes the mood would lighten — they would put on a movie — but then a guard would come by and say that the children would be sent away to live in a foster home and never see their parents again.” Though allegations of poor treatment at CBP facilities have surfaced regularly for years, including under the Obama administration, the new interviews suggest that harsh conditions have been exacerbated by the Trump administration’s ""zero tolerance"" policy. Announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April, the policy mandated that US Attorneys' Offices prosecute every person caught entering the country illegally, and resulted in the systematic separation of parents and children at the border because the kids could not accompany the adults into federal custody. The immigrants’ testimonies also document some of the confusion that has resulted from the Trump administration’s new policies. Several immigrants described being yelled at to sign documents that they couldn’t read, and in one case, a single mother described being temporarily separated from her teenage son after he was deported to Juarez, Mexico, in what immigration officials later told her was a mistake. The Trump administration’s border crackdown has been stymied somewhat, following an executive order declaring an end to family separations. A subsequent court order mandated that the government reunite the more than 2,000 children with parents from whom they were separated at the border.In the Flores case, US District Judge Dolly Gee rejected a recent attempt by the Trump administration to amend the 1997 settlement to allow indefinite detentions of families as an alternative to separating parents and children, calling it a “thinly veiled” effort to raise challenges to the settlement that the judge had already considered and denied. But lawyers representing immigrant children in that case claim that the government continues to violate the settlement, and point to the toll that Trump’s policies have already taken on children in federal immigration custody. One single parent in CBP custody, identified as Mayra, said her 9-year-old son continues to be anxious after seeing parents separated from their children at a facility in Nogales, Arizona. “He saw someone bound with chains and asked me whether I would be chained in the same way,” she said. “He wonders when we will get to the United States. I do not tell him that we are already here. He wouldn’t believe that the United States would treat us this way.”"	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/19/19/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/i-feel-like-i-am-trash-immigrant-children-describ-2-29068-1532043526-4_dblbig.jpg2d39dc196fda4ded9ca07e71225611cc	['Buzzfeed News Reporter']		US Officials Are Planning To Reunite Thousands Of More Children Who Were Separated At The Border	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	US	US Officials Are Planning To Reunite Thousands Of More Children Who Were Separated At The Border	0	"Federal officials are also warning that they are having to use less vigorous parental vetting methods in order to meet the court-ordered deadline.Matt York / APThe US government on Friday said it is preparing to reunify up to 2,551 children over the age of 5 who were separated from their parents at the border by immigration authorities. The Trump administration said it would begin the reunifications Friday and continue them on a rolling basis in order to meet a July 26 deadline set by a federal judge. It will be the second group of kids — the previous one involved children under 5 — that the federal government is being forced to reunite as a result of the court order. The age of 5 has been used to delineate between younger “tender age” children deemed to be a higher priority for reunification. While the more than 2,500 kids have been identified as potential class members of a court order to reunite the families, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is tasked with caring for the children, said it doesn't expect to reunify all of them with adults. ""It is not, nor should it be, our objective to reunify all 2,551 minors with the adult with whom they arrived here, because some of those adults are not their parents or pose a clear danger to the children,"" said Evelyn Stauffer, an HHS spokesperson. ""There are many circumstances that preclude a minor from being reunited with a parent, including when a purported parent ends up not to be a parent, a parent poses a threat to the child's well-being, or a parent is in custody elsewhere due to criminal activity."" The government may later find that some of the children in the 2,551 are not subject to the court order.Lynne Sladky / AP Buena Ventura Martin-Godinez, center, holds her son Pedro, left, as she is reunited with her daughter Janne (right) at Miami International Airport on July 1.In the status report, attorneys for the Department of Justice said that unlike many of the reunifications for kids under 5, the plan for the older group of kids will not involve DNA tests, full background checks, or criminal background checks of other adults in the houses where the child will live, which were scrapped in order to meet the July 26 deadline. The truncated process, however, poses significant risks to child welfare, the attorneys warned. ""While most children should be safely reunited with their actual parents by the court’s deadline, the class is large and the agencies must proceed rapidly and without the procedures that HHS would ordinarily use to place a child with a parent safely,"" the court filing states. US District Judge Dana Sabraw responded to the government's claims late Friday night, writing that the government ""either does not understand the Court’sorders or is acting in defiance of them."" Sabraw said his orders were clear that the government did need to verify parentage and that reunification would not put a child in danger, and that the government's latest filing called into question whether they were acting in ""good faith."" ""At a minimum, it appears [HHS official Christopher Meekins] is attempting to provide cover to Defendants for their own conduct in the practice of family separation, and the lack of foresight and infrastructure necessary to remedy the harms caused by that practice,"" Sabraw wrote. The filing came hours after a court hearing Friday afternoon, during which Sabraw said he was encouraged by the progress made on reunifications, but also indicated he would remain hands-on leading up to the July 26 reunification deadline. He set dates for status reports and hearings, and said he expected the government to continue to regularly communicate not only with the court but with the ACLU as well. ""There is substantial compliance, there is good faith being demonstrated in no uncertain terms and measure by the government. There is a collaborative process that’s well underway,"" Sabraw said. ""There are some bumps to be expected and there will continue to be, but the parties are really working through the issues in a really measured and successful way given the enormity of the undertaking.""David J. Phillip / AP A mother migrating from Honduras holds her 1-year-old child in the back of a transport van after surrendering to Border Patrol agents June 25.The government is providing the ACLU with a list of likely class members covered by Sabraw’s June reunification order — parents who were separated from a child and are not deemed unfit or dangerous to the child — and also a list of separated children. Sabraw said the government’s lists of parents should e broken down into five categories: parents in ICE custody, parents in federal criminal custody, parents in state criminal custody, parents who had been released into the United States, and parents who had been removed from the United States. Deported parents have proved particularly difficult to reunify because the government stops tracking their location once they leave. The administration has provided information about those parents to the ACLU in an effort to find them. Justice Department lawyer Sarah Fabian told Sabraw on Friday that the difficulty in compiling a list of families eligible for reunification was that it required the HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to sit down together and “marry” the information they each have into a master list. The reunifications would happen at a small number of facilities, which the government expected would simplify tracking, she added. ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt asked to continue receiving information about parents deemed ineligible for reunification, in case there were mistakes — he said the ACLU had just learned about a father who was deemed ineligible despite having adoption papers for his child. Sabraw said the government should provide that information, but any issues could be worked out after most reunifications take place. Gelernt expressed concern that if parents already had final removal orders, there would be mass deportations — possibly starting as soon as the weekend — before parents had a chance to decide what they wanted for their child; a child might still have asylum claims to pursue or other options besides removal. Fabian, though, said she did not have information on the matter. Sabraw said the ACLU could submit papers over the weekend if that appeared to be happening; however, Fabian had argued the judge did not have the authority to block removals from taking place on a mass basis.Eric Gay / AP Immigrants from Cuba and Guatemala seeking asylum in the United States wait on the Matamoros International Bridge above the Rio Grande on June 29.Fabian said the government had reunified several families with children under 5 without completing the process for verifying that the adults were, in fact, a parent, saying they understood Sabraw at a previous hearing to have ordered reunifications to occur by the deadline even if that relationship wasn’t verified. But Sabraw said that was not his order — instead, it was that the government should verify a parent-child relationship, but not feel the need to do it through DNA testing, which had been holding up reunifications. Sabraw said the government could rely on documents or other “common sense” means of satisfying that a parent was a parent. The government has said it will conduct the reunifications at six to eight ICE locations, with officials vetting parents using its own summaries to look for disqualifying criminal history and HHS records for anything that raises questions about parentage, parental fitness, or child safety. The judge also ordered the government to provide 12 hours' notice before a reunification was scheduled to take place. The ACLU had said in an earlier filing that they heard about problems with a few families being reunited and released without any support or resources. “There shouldn’t be anything mysterious about it,” Sabraw said. The next court hearing is scheduled for Monday."	https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-07/13/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-28126-1531529320-1.jpg?crop=1600:837;0,230721c41860a434c10be50771bd51903d8	[]		Government Archives * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	Government Archives * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"Stay In The Loop!SubscribeDon't miss a single thing.

The media and the Democrat Party ignored her.In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Leslie Millwee says she was thinking about coming out publicly around 1998, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal began to dominate the national conversation. But at the time, she says she decided to remain quiet, in part fearing for her children after watching the way other Clinton sex accusers were treated by the Clintons and the news media.Three of Millwee’s friends told Breitbart News that she told them in the late 1990’s that Clinton sexually assaulted her while she was a reporter and that the future president allegedly knocked on her apartment door.Trending: BREAKING: Man Claims He Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]Millwee claims the assaults took place in a small, isolated editing room at her now-defunct station, KLMN-TV, which covered the Fort Smith/Fayetteville markets.

How are you today?” This went on, Millwee says, for several months.Millwee claims that as part of his attempts to come on to her, Clinton gave her half of his tie and told her that she should give him more attention and hold onto the tie because one day he would be the U.S. president.She also says that Clinton signed his name to a page on her reporter’s notebook that had her own name on it, writing “Clinton” directly above her name.“And I said, ‘What are you doing? Giving me an autograph now?’ And he said, ‘No, I just wanted to show you how good Clinton looks on top of Leslie.’”Millwee provided Breitbart News with an image of Clinton’s alleged signature on her reporter’s notebook.

She says that Clinton departed after she purportedly refused to respond.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, former Democrat presidential candidate and wife of Bill Clinton, the man who’s been accused multiple times of sexual assault and even rape, appeared Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show where she told Maddow that she believes Christine Blasey Ford deserves the benefit of the doubt in her 36-year-old sexual assault accusation against President Trump’s Supreme Court Justice nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Clinton told Maddow: “I remember back in the Thomas hearing when Senator Byrd was asked what he was going to do, and he said in a situation like this we should give the benefit of the doubt to the court and the country,” Clinton said Tuesday. “And that’s what the Republicans should be doing right now, from the White House down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Senate, give the benefit of the doubt to the court and the country. And that means having an investigation that will then lead to a hearing that will then lead to a vote if appropriate. And instead, they are playing the hardest of hardballs to try to pack the court with, you know, another nominee, regardless of the questions.”Millwee just posted her message to Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA), where she asked that she be “believed” by the senior Democrat Senator:"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/milwee-schumer-1200x630.jpg41e7a205f3b940f7b188532bfb334d12	[]	2018-09-26 15:19:17-04:00	BREAKING: Man Who Claims He Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN] * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	BREAKING: Man Who Claims He Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN] * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"Creepy porn lawyer, Michael Avenetti, has managed to locate a third Kavanaugh accuser, who claims she was drugged and raped at a high school party.

It’s interesting to note, that some of the most notable attacks on President Trump over the past week don’t have anything to do with Russia. It’s almost as though ever since President Trump demanded that the FISA warrant for Carter Page and FBI text messages are declassified without redaction, the media has moved away from the phony Trump-Russia collusion narrative??Just in the past 3 weeks, an anonymous op-ed was published in the Trump-hating New York Times, from a “senior officials in the White House”. Last week, Diane Feinstein dropped a bombshell about an anonymous letter from a woman, who turned out to be a Democrat activist. In her letter, that was delivered in July to Senator Feinstein, Christine Blasey Ford accused Trump’s US Supreme Court Justice candidate, Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault 36 years ago. And only yesterday, the New York Times dropped another bombshell, claiming Deputy AG, Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire to reveal “the chaos” inside President Trump’s White House, to use as evidence to help invoke the 25th Amendment, used to remove a sitting President who is deemed “unfit” to serve.Last night, however, over 11,000 Americans showed their allegiance to President Trump and his steadfast resolve to “drain the swamp”, as they flocked to the Missouri State University campus to support our President and to hear Trump speak.It was a sea of red. The number of people who wore “Make America Great Again” caps and pro-Trump shirts far outweighed a few hundred protesters gathered near the entrance of the arena. Fans of the president were in a celebratory mood. They took photos with a life-sized cardboard cutout of Trump and proudly showed off their apparel. Protesters, though fewer in number, were loud as they led chants and hoisted homemade signs.

The report suggests that Julie Swetnick’s ex-boyfriend filed a restraining order against her for some disturbing violence-related issues. This was back in 2001.Swetnick accused Kavanaugh, Trump’s nominee for Supreme Court, of attending house parties where women were reportedly sexually assaulted. Swetnick has reportedly attended the same parties, multiple times, and was highly criticized by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for repeatedly going to parties where women were supposedly assaulted (including herself), but not telling anyone. Specifically, Graham said on video “If you went to a party once where people are being drugged and gang-raped, you wouldn’t go to the next nine, that you would tell somebody, and that you have an obligation if you see people being abused to come forward and say something about it, if not for yourself, for them.”Trending: BREAKING: Man Claims He Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]Swetnick, who is represented by attorney Michael Avenatti, dubbed the “Creepy Porn Lawyer” on Tucker Carlson’s show, faced the restraining order in Miami-Dade County.take our poll - story continues belowWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

He suggested that it was irrelevant and said “Complete nonsense. No truth to this at all. Her ex-boyfriend fraudulently used her resume to apply for and obtain jobs and was caught by her,” said Avenatti. “Why are you all attacking a sexual assault victim? Would that be appropriate in a court of law?”If that’s Avenatti’s response to this, then it doesn’t actually make any sense. Based on Politico’s article, it seems like Avenatti went directly to ask why people are going after a sexual assault victim. That’s very defensive. Is that a strategy for someone who doesn’t have anything credible to share or discuss?It is quite telling that Avenatti would go right on the defensive and suggest that people are attacking her, or even her credibility, when a restraining order that has something to do with threatening someone’s family, including a child, is involved.The Politico article then stated that Swetnick provided a sworn statement claiming that she met Kavanaugh between 1980-1981 and went to over 10 house parties where he and Mike Judge were possibly in attendance. She is not accusing him of sexually assaulting her, but it seems like she just wants people to know that he was there when she was a victim of sexual assault by multiple boys.So basically, she’s saying that he didn’t do it, but maybe he was there.So why is she relevant? She produced a sworn statement that Kavanaugh didn’t sexually assault her, so what exactly is the point of her talking about this at all if not to just get five minutes of fame?At this point, it doesn’t make sense why she’s called an accuser when she admits he didn’t do anything. Who is she accusing? It’s not Brett Kavanaugh, so why is she even relative right now? Why isn’t she going after the people who allegedly raped her? Like Graham said, why did she go back to these parties over 10 times if there was sexual assault going on? That doesn’t make sense either. She doesn’t sound credible one bit.Her ex-boyfriend stated “I have a lot of facts, evidence, that what she’s saying is not true at all,” he said. “I would rather speak to my attorney first before saying more.”Avenatti blasted the press for “digging into the past” of a woman who stepped forward and is willing to testify under oath” – which is ironic because that’s exactly what people are doing to Kavanaugh.The ex-boyfriend is 63-years-old and a registered Democrat according to Miami-Dade records (per Politico’s article). Maybe he should have a lawyer and be ready to testify.If Democrats are going to destroy Brett Kavanaugh, then one of them can pitch in to destroy Avenatti and Swetnick as well.This is one huge mess that resembles a circus."	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/julie-swetnick-kavanaugh.jpgf95c451e74f2406eb46c23ea2c3cffc6	[]	2018-09-26 20:36:41-04:00	BREAKING: KAVANAUGH ACCUSER Made Previous Sexual Harassment Claim...Represented By Ford Lawyer Debra Katz's Law Firm! * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	BREAKING: KAVANAUGH ACCUSER Made Previous Sexual Harassment Claim...Represented By Ford Lawyer Debra Katz's Law Firm! * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"YOU CAN’T MAKE THIS STUFF UP!A decade ago, Julie Swetnick made a sexual harassment complaint against her former employer, New York Life Insurance.

Senator Lindsey Graham asked the best question yet on the Kavanaugh accuser and we’re beginning to get some answers to his question:Senator Graham: Here is what I want your audience to know. If Miss Ford really did not want to come forward, never intended to come forward, never planned to come forward, why did she pay for a polygraph in August and why did she hire a lawyer in August if she never intended to do what she’s doing?… And who’s paid for it?DEBRA KATZDebra Katz, the attorney for Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is vice chair of the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) which has been directly funded by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.She’s donated about $24K to liberal causes including Moveon.org and had this to say about Trump advisors on Facebook:“These people are all miscreants. The term ‘basket of deplorables’ is far too generous a description for these people who are now Senior Trump advisors.”Debra Katz is a known lawyer who specializes in the representation of whistleblowers. How was it that she was hired months ago to represent Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser? Remember that Senator Feinstein claimed that the anonymous person wanted to stay anonymous.

We have seen reports today that Julie Swetnik, who says she graduated from Gaithersburg high school, submitted a declaration to the committee alleging that Brett participated in horrific conduct during high school, including targeting girls for gang rape. Nonsense. We never witnessed any behavior that even approaches what is described in this allegation. It is reprehensible.In the extensive amount we collectively spent with Brett, we do no recall having ever met someone name Julie Swetnik. Nor did we ever observe Brett engaging in conduct resembling that described in Miss Swetnik’s declaration.Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. He has always treated women with respect and decency. He is a man of honor, integrity, and compassion. These shameful attacks must end. This process is a disgrace and is harming good people.PJMEDIA Reports that classmate Lisa Miller said: “In 1981, I attended parties with football players from Georgetown Prep,” Miller says. She acknowledges that underage drinking occurred at these parties. “NEVER did I witness behavior that Julie Swetnick describe, ever.”CREEPY PORN LAWYER:Given Avenatti’s behavior, anyone who allows him to represent them is setting themselves up for more scrutiny. This man was the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels. He’s one of those lawyers that gives his profession a questionable reputation.THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN QUESTIONS RAISED ON THIS WOMAN’S TIMELINE:Since a third accuser has come forward, Judge Kavanaugh has had to refute the claims of attending parties where his accuser says girls were drugged and then gang-raped. Kavanaugh came out with a short statement:Statement from Judge Kavanaugh on Julie Swetnick allegations: “This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone. I don’t know who this is and this never happened.”Sixty of Brett Kavanaugh’s classmates from high school have come out in support of him and refute the claims from Swetnick (see below).Julie Swetnick claims that Brett Kavanaugh attended parties where young men drugged the young girls then gang-raped them. The problem with this claim is that she had graduated from high school three years prior to the time she says she attended the parties. The legal drinking age was 18 back then so why would a young women in college go to these high school parties several times where she knew drugs and gang rape was happening? Very strange.Joe Concha tweeted: This is interesting: Julie Swetnick graduated Gaithersburg HS in ’80. Brett Kavanaugh graduated Georgetown Prep in ’83.

Wouldn’t this be all over high school and wouldn’t someone say something?Why did she keep going back to numerous parties where gang rape was taking place and why didn’t she do anything about it?This entire story smells to high heaven.

The accusations mentioned gang rape during the early 1980’s, most likely around 1982.Lindsey Graham doesn’t sound like he’s falling for the woman’s story. He was on video saying:“If you went to a party once where people are being drugged and gang-raped, you wouldn’t go to the next nine, that you would tell somebody, and that you have an obligation if you see people being abused to come forward and say something about it, if not for yourself, for them. So I’m very suspicious of this. He says he doesn’t know the lady. He says he never hung out with the lady, and the more we know about the difference in age and time, it, it smells bad to me.

It doesn’t sound very specific nor does it sound like Kavanaugh had anything to do with any alleged rape. Just being somewhere doesn’t make one a rapist.Swetnick’s story continues, according to CBS News:“I also witnessed efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys,” Swetnick alleged. “I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room. These boys included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh.” “In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these ‘gang’ or ‘train’ rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present,” Swetnick continued. “Shortly after the incident, I shared what had transpired with at least two other people. During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me.”Again – the issue with this is that it doesn’t actually suggest that Kavanaugh has participated in anything. She suggests that they were there, but she does not technically use any language that suggests Brett Kavanaugh had actually participated in any sort of rape activity.Why does that matter? Because if they were in a court of law and an attorney asks “was Brett Kavanaugh there” and the answer is yes, that doesn’t mean anything. If an attorney asks “did Brett Kavanaugh rape you or rape someone else” – then that’s a completely different question and answer. If the accuser says yes and gives specifics, then they might have a case.This seems to be a bit shady because Swetnick seems to be alleging that Kavanaugh was there, but is there any language that dictates Kavanaugh was participating in a rape?That answer, as far as I can tell, is no.That would mean this accusation is essentially pointless because it’s not actually indicating Kavanaugh in a crime. It’s just saying that she thinks he was present at a party where an alleged rape happened.I think her narrative is busted.Lindsey Graham’s point about attending the party, then continuing to go after allegedly seeing a rape happen, is a grand slam.Who goes to a party, witnesses rape, and then goes to nine more of the same party?"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/lg.jpgf823669270664f218d2b11832376f9b3	[]	2018-09-26 17:47:42-04:00	"TRUMP'S MASTERFUL PRESS CONFERENCE: ""If we brought George Washington here and we said we have George Washington, the Democrats would vote against him"" [Video] * 100PercentFedUp.com"	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	"TRUMP'S MASTERFUL PRESS CONFERENCE: ""If we brought George Washington here and we said we have George Washington, the Democrats would vote against him"" [Video] * 100PercentFedUp.com"	0	"PRESIDENT TRUMP’S United Nations press conference has been out of this world good.

But in Ford’s letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in July, Ford gave a different tally, writing that the gathering “included me and 4 others.”That’s a huge discrepancy. Which one is it? Five people or more than five? If it’s just Ford and four boys, then she probably would be able to remember them. If it’s a larger group, then she also would have remembered that. Why does it seem like Ford said both, leading readers to believe she’s not sure which one it really is?Fox News continued:“All of the witnesses Ford has identified at the party, including Kavanaugh, Judge, and another classmate, Patrick Smyth, have denied knowledge of the alleged assault under penalty of felony in statements to the Judiciary Committee. However, a woman, Leland Ingham Keyser, a former classmate of Ford’s at the Holton-Arms all-girls school in Maryland, has since been identified by Ford as the fourth witness at the party. In a dramatic twist, Keyser emerged Saturday night to say she doesn’t know Kavanaugh or remember being at the party with him.”The witnesses deny anything happened. Another witness emerged, a woman, and she denies knowing him or being at a party with him. Now those “witnesses” don’t seem like witnesses anymore because there’s possibly no story that actually exists. Usually, the person making such hard accusations would have at least one witness come forward, but there’s none so far.And now the polygraph. You can read it at the link below, or continue reading my report on it.READ THE FORD POLYGRAPH TEST – CLICK HERE!Apparently the polygraph had two majorly relevant questions. “Is any part of your statement false?” and “Did you make up any part of your statement?” Irrelevent questions are often asked to determine a baseline physiological response, which Fox News reported that it helps detect deception upon lies on the relevant questions.Fox News kept going:The test measured “thoracic and abdominal respiration, galvanic skin response, and cardiac activity,” Hanafin wrote in the report. The former FBI agent then ran the results of Ford’s two “no” responses through three separate scoring algorithms, including one developed by Johns Hopkins University. All three algorithms concluded that Ford’s responses did not indicate apparent deception, with one putting the probability that she was lying at .002 and another putting it at less than .02. “It’s not the result of the polygraph; it is what polygraph subjects say during the polygraph interview that is most valuable,” said Thomas Mauriello, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Maryland who worked as a senior polygraph examiner at the Defense Department. “The result of a polygraph simply is whether you did or did not respond to a particular question. A response is not a lie, because the polygraph is not a lie detector as most think,” Mauriello added. “A response is the activation of your sympathetic nervous system when answering a question asked during the examination.”After all of this, it’s no surprise that people have various opinions on this.Lindsey Graham (R-SC) asked “If Ms. Ford really did not want to come forward, never intended to come forward … why did she pay for a polygraph in August, and why did she hire a lawyer in August? And who paid for it?” It was noted that polygraph tests can cost around $1,000.That’s a good question. If someone accuses another person of sexual assault but has no intention of going through with their story, then why are they paying for a polygraph test?What exactly is the point of that? That’s very similar to asking someone why Ford went to Feinstein instead of the police, which allows us to question the true motive in her accusations.When it’s all said and done, it should be known that polygraphs can be beaten.“James Gagliano, a former FBI agent who led a SWAT team in New York for several years and now teaches at St. John’s University, told Fox News that while polygraphs are valuable, they “can be beaten.” Gagliano, who said he was subjected to several polygraphs at the FBI but never administered one himself, said people can sometimes pass polygraphs if they’ve convinced themselves they are telling the truth: “It’s not a lie if you believe it,” he said. “Everyone knows polygraph exams can be beaten,” Gagliano added. “If someone is a psychopath or a sociopath, if you don’t have a conscience, if you don’t know right from wrong — you can beat it.”The Right Scoop pointed out some other discrepancies with Ford’s polygraph.Note the date on the Polygraph: August 7th. According to Ford’s original letter to Feinstein, she said: I am currently vacationing in the mid-Atlantic until August 7th and will be in California after August 10th.If she was away until August 7th, and then again until August 10, then did she stop in between travels to take a random polygraph?Benny Johnson from the Daily Caller pointed out that Ford allegedly changed her story, of course, with the number of people who were there.Christine Blasey Ford has changed her story multiple (!) times: For Polygraph: ""Four boys and a couple girls."" To Feinstein: “Four others” To Washington Post: “Four boys at the party.” To CNN: ""Four boys and a girl"" AGAIN: No one remembers this partyhttps://t.co/c73TlMp9XJ — Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 26, 2018Paul Sperry questions if this was some guy named Brett, or actually Brett Kavanaugh, which is a very good thing to consider."	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/poly.jpgcb9159b424cb4687bd1fd7e46f3ecd50	[]	2018-09-26 16:20:14-04:00	JUST IN: JUDGE KAVANAUGH ACCUSER'S Timeline On Claims Of Attending Rape Parties Comes Into Question * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	JUST IN: JUDGE KAVANAUGH ACCUSER'S Timeline On Claims Of Attending Rape Parties Comes Into Question * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"Since a third accuser has come forward, Judge Kavanaugh has had to refute the claims of attending parties where his accuser says girls were drugged and then gang-raped.

Two points: There is no proof that he was at the parties and she NEVER said he raped her or even touched her if he was there.Why have no other people come forward and why hasn’t anyone come forward from those years when this supposedly happened? Wouldn’t this be all over high school and wouldn’t someone say something?Why did she keep going back to numerous parties where gang rape was taking place and why didn’t she do anything about it?60 of Brett Kavanaugh’s classmates from high school came out in support of him:This entire story smells to high heaven.

Julie Swetnick, 55-year-old certified systems engineer has come forward accusing Judge Kavanaugh of participating in spiking drinks to make it easier to rape the party attendees.Julie Swetnick claims she “attended well over ten house parties in the Washington DC area during 1981 to 1983 were Mark Judge, and Brett Kavanaugh were present. These parties were a common occurrence in the area and occurred nearly every weekend during the school year.”Trending: BREAKING: Man Claims He Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]take our poll - story continues belowWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

We are not aware of a single charge that was filed against Kavanaugh or any other male at these regular weekend parties/orgies, that the accuser attended over and over again, in spite of her description of these parties. During the years 1981-82, I became aware of efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to “spike” the “punch” at house parties I attended with drugs and/or alcohol to cause girls to lose their inhibitions and their ability to say “NO.”We have a problem with this woman’s account because she claims she went to several of these parties yet she NEVER reported the rapes nor did anything to stop it…SHE KEPT GOING BACK!I don’t know, maybe it’s just me, but as a woman, if I knew other girls were getting raped at a party I attended, I would have at the very least, told my parents or someone who could’ve prevented further rapes. I probably wouldn’t have gone back to several more of the same types of parties. But, that’s just me. I’m guessing, however, that I’m not alone…Swetnick’s lawyer can’t even say that Judge Kavanaugh ever touched her. Notice how he dodges the question:Here is Avenatti moments ago, getting asked if his client was ever touched by Kavanaugh. ""The allegations are far more specific relating to Brett Kavanaugh's conduct towards women in general — Many of these women ended up gang raped unfortunately.""

Avenatti is the lawyer for Stormy Daniels.Swetnick is a resident of Washington, D.C. and worked for the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department, and Justice Department.CNBC reports:Swetnick said these efforts by Kavanaugh and his buddy Mark Judge were done so the girls “could then be ‘gang-raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys.”“I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room.WHY DID SHE GO TO THESE PARTIES OVER AND OVER?She also said in her affidavit sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee that in approximately 1982 “I became the victim of one of these ‘gang’ or ‘train’ rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present.”Correction: Our original title said that Swetnik went back to parties after being raped. We cannot substantiate that she attended more parties after she claimed she was raped. She claimed that she was present at several parties where other girls were raped, but did nothing about it, until eventually, she too, was allegedly gang raped."	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/105472453-1537973678647julie.530x298-1200x630.jpg1380cfeb96ce4dbf96cc9a226741b2d6	[]	2018-09-26 09:04:27-04:00	"MICHELLE OBAMA: Vote...Even Though You Know ""Nothin' About Nothin'"" [Video] * 100PercentFedUp.com"	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	"MICHELLE OBAMA: Vote...Even Though You Know ""Nothin' About Nothin'"" [Video] * 100PercentFedUp.com"	0	"Michelle Obama spoke at a rally in Las Vegas, encouraging people to vote in the midterm elections.

The Lois Lerner controversy occurred in 2013 and involved revelations showing that the IRS unfairly scrutinized conservative groups.SHEEHY: “John Koskinen. He got a lot of flak for giving increased scrutiny to these Tea Party groups. Conservatives got really mad at him, he was so cool though because he deleted all the emails, so they could not hold any evidence against him.”Sheehy continues:SHEEHY: “Yeah, I don’t give a s**t if that is a crime for doing that because… you should give increased scrutiny to those groups because a lot of them are just f***ing fronts for the Koch brothers or whatever.”Mistakes Were MadeIn a separate meeting, attorney Semasek discloses to Project Veritas multiple times that “mistakes were made,” during the 2013 scandal when conservative non-profits were targeted when applying for tax-exempt status.SEMASEK: “… you know what, for what it’s worth, on the record, I know people in Tax Exempt Government Entities.

And it turns out that they were like the Tea Party group of people.

Bob Corker (R-TN) told reporters “I go into the hearings with very positive feelings about him, and I hope Thursday goes well” as reported by Fox News.Kavanaugh briefly faced another accusation by a Yale classmate named Deborah Ramirez, but that seems to have been squashed as her story doesn’t add up and it doesn’t appear that she is certain who or what she actually saw. Her claim was that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her while he was intoxicated at a college party back in the 1980’s, an allegation that Kavanaugh has also denied.Fox News has learned that Judiciary Committee staffers interviewed Kavanaugh by phone about the Ramirez allegations on Tuesday. A source familiar with the call told Fox News that Republican staffers led the interview, while Democratic aides listened without asking any questions.Fox News stated that a successful vote this Friday isn’t required to push him to the Senate. “Current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas received no recommendation from the Judiciary Committee in 1991, but was still confirmed by the Senate. Conversely, Robert Bork received an unfavorable recognition from the committee in 1987, though his nomination was rejected by the full Senate.”Politico also reported “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can bring Kavanaugh to the floor whether the nominee gets a favorable or unfavorable recommendation. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is undecided on Kavanaugh’s nomination and is the key swing vote on the panel; Flake has not voted in the Senate this week and has not commented on his current thinking about Kavanaugh.“For Republicans to schedule a Friday vote on Brett Kavanaugh today, two days before Dr. Blasey Ford has had a chance to tell her story, is outrageous,” said Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee’s ranking member. “First Republicans demanded Dr. Blasey Ford testify immediately. Now Republicans don’t even need to hear her before they move ahead with a vote.”If you think about the timeline of events, Brett Kavanaugh could be confirmed by now if there was no sideshow brought to town by Democrat resisters.Even if Christine Blasey Ford testified yesterday, as she was originally invited to, that means Kavanaugh could have been voted on today.The Democrats seem to have a stalling tactic underway as they keep trying to dig up old accusations, or possibly make them up as they go along.Kavanaugh should be presumed innocent unless proven guilty.This could turn out to be a massive smear campaign by anti-Trumpers.It was previously reported that Diane Feinstein wasn’t certain if Christine Blasey Ford will show up. Ford has had some demands, but it’s unsure if they’ll be met. She has to remember that she doesn’t run the show and when she’s given the opportunity to have her voice heard, then she should take it and stop making so many demands.NEW: Sen.

Schumer responded with “there is no presumption of innocence or guilt” because it’s not a criminal trial.Watch Schumer on video.Chuck Schumer on Judge Kavanaugh: “There is no presumption of innocence” https://t.co/bSxoRW5Qmr pic.twitter.com/qQhEZ74YtB — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) September 25, 2018What Schumer forgets is that it may not be a criminal trial, but sexual assault is a crime and throwing false accusations at someone can ruin their life, career, or even end up in people taking their own lives.Ford’s accusations and story don’t need to be pushed in a criminal trial in order for Kavanaugh to warrant the presumption of innocence.Everyone who is accused of a possibly fabricated story like Ford’s deserves the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.Ford’s story is very shaky and the timing of it reaks of a circus act turned into a character assassination plot.Schumer also stated that they should get to the bottom of the situation and find the facts as well as let the FBI do their job. However, Kavanaugh has already been thoroughly vetted and it appears as though the FBI has no interest in investigating the allegations on Kavanaugh, from Ford.The GOP is giving the Democrat what they want and Ford has had her time extended, but she and her team keep making ridiculous requests.It’s time for Ford to testify and get this over with.Kavanaugh shouldn’t have to deal with this.We can see right through it and it smells of anti-Trump nonsense dripping from the clown car filled of Democrats.Why don’t the FBI check Ford’s bank accounts?Is someone paying her?"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chuck-1200x630.jpg5109e8d6386747208b3d947fbd646d7a	[]	2018-09-25 14:54:25-04:00	ANTIFA THREATENS TED CRUZ ON TWITTER After Chasing Him And His Wife From DC Restaurant…Plan To Make Cruz Look Bad INSTANTLY Backfires! * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	ANTIFA THREATENS TED CRUZ ON TWITTER After Chasing Him And His Wife From DC Restaurant…Plan To Make Cruz Look Bad INSTANTLY Backfires! * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"Last night, conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz (TX) was shouted out of Fiola by Antifa, while dining with his wife, Heidi, in the upscale Italian restaurant in Washington DC. “Smash Racism DC” posted videos on Twitter showing how they were able to surround the table where Cruz and his wife were sitting for dinner.

If that was the case, the Obama’s would never experience another peaceful meal for the rest of their lives, but Republicans just don’t behave this way. Every day Americans are stunned by this childish, bullying behavior. It’s goes against everything we teach our children about not bullying or picking on someone else because you don’t like them, or because they’re different than you. These are adult bullies, who are being given a pass by the mainstream media and the Democrat Party, simply because they hold the same views, so therefore they’re a valuable member of the same team.The tweet is ironic, in that it calls Ted Cruz’s votes a “death wish” when we all know the real reason the left is freaking out over Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court is over their fear he’ll take the legal right for women to kill their babies away from them.p1. No—you can’t eat in peace—your politics are an attack on all of us You’re votes are a death wish. Your votes are hate crimes. Tonight Senator Ted Cruz arrived at Fiola, an upscale restaurant mere steps from the White House, to enjoy a hearty Italian dinner. https://t.co/7vRsLmXd0Z — Smash Racism DC (@SmashRacismDC) September 25, 2018The Smash Racism DC account further threatens Ted Cruz, shaming him over daring to take his wife to dinner at a nice restaurant in DC, while illegal immigrants sit in (Obama’s) cages. The Smash Racism DC group, whose members include, Resist This, DC IWW, members of DC Democratic Socialists of America, Anarchists, women, sexual assault survivors, and members of the LGBTQ community warns Cruz “and others like him” that they are “not safe”.In spite of their threats against a sitting US Senator and “others like him”, Twitter has allowed the account for the violent Antifa group to remain on their platform, even after many were calling for Twitter to ban their account.It turns out, that these disgusting acts of chasing public officials out of public spaces is not really helping their comrades in the Democrat Party to win elections.After threatening Ted Cruz on Twitter, the Smash Racism DC Twitter account received only one tweet of praise or encouragement. They were absolutely hammered, however, with negative responses to their bullying tactics, like this one of a child having a temper tantrum:This Twitter user admits that these tweets only make him want to vote for Ted Cruz:Honestly videos like these makes me wanna vote Ted Cruz more & more — Tim (@Tim58761407) September 25, 2018This Twitter user hit the nail on the head, reminding them that they are the real racists for chasing a Latino out of a restaurant over his opposing political views:Smash racism by forcing a Latino out of a restaurant based on his politics.

The dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear capable missiles, increase internal repression, finance terrorism and fund havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen.”President Trump also focused on North Korea:“Since that meeting, we have already seen a number of encouraging measures that few could have imagined, only a short time ago. The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction. Nuclear testing has stopped. Some military facilities are already being dismantled.

In fact, the obnoxious, media whore, Democrat activist/lawyer, who appears frequently on CNN and MSNBC, spent quite a bit of time on Twitter yesterday, bragging about his “credible sources”In his first tweet, Avenatti said he represented a woman with “credible information” regarding Judge Kavanaugh and his high school friend, Mark Judge.Trending: BREAKING: Man Who Claims He Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]take our poll - story continues belowWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Avenatti went on to describe how credible his client is because she has “multiple security clearances in the past including Public Trust & Secret”. Avenatti threatened the GOP that they “better be very careful in trying to suggest that she is not credible”.From The Hill– On Sunday, Avenatti tweeted a screenshot of an email he sent to Mike Davis, the chief counsel for nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the email, Avenatti said he is “aware of significant evidence of multiple house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the early 1980s, during which Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, and others would participate in the targeting of women with alcohol/drugs to allow a ‘train’ of men to subsequently gang rape them.” “There are multiple witnesses that will corroborate these facts and each of them must be called to testify publicly,” Avenatti wrote. Here’s the tweet with the screen shot of the email to Mike Davis:Avenatti has declined to disclose most of the details about his client, though he told Politico that “she’s had multiple security clearances over the years, including public trust and secret security clearance.”This morning, liberals were stunned to find the creepy porn lawyer and Democrat Party presidential hopeful’s Twitter account had been locked down (see screenshot below).What’s the matter, Michael? Cat got your tongue?Why would the creepy porn lawyer who is never at a loss for words want to lock down his own Twitter account?Liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow interviewed the creepy porn lawyer on her show, where she gave Avenatti the opportunity to defend his client’s allegation that she was a sexual victim of Judge Kavanaugh. To her credit, Maddow called Avenatti out on asking for an FBI investigation without ever having a criminal investigation into the allegations. Throughout the interview, Maddow, who would love to take down President Trump’s pick for the next Supreme Court Justice as much as any liberal in the media, appears to be skeptical of Avenatti and his far-fetched story.Watch:"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/avenatti--1200x630.jpg09d21e43260f40d0822feb42bbe5ba42	[]	2018-09-25 10:14:51-04:00	PRESIDENT TRUMP Fights For Kavanaugh With A Huge Reminder For Supporters * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	PRESIDENT TRUMP Fights For Kavanaugh With A Huge Reminder For Supporters * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"President Trump shot out some bold tweets late last night in support of Judge Brett Kavanaugh:The Democrats are working hard to destroy a wonderful man and a man who has the potential to be one of our greatest Supreme Court Justices ever, with an array of False Accusations the likes of which have never been seen before!The Democrats are working hard to destroy a wonderful man, and a man who has the potential to be one of our greatest Supreme Court Justices ever, with an array of False Accusations the likes of which have never been seen before! — Donald J.

The left is counting on taking over the House and Senate so they can do everything possible to destroy President Trump. That may sound extreme but THEY are extreme! The Democrats have called for harassment and even violence against President Trump, his cabinet members, and his supporters. We are in a battle for the heart and soul of America. Please vote!The unhinged liberals left messages below the two tweets from the president that are disgusting and shocking. The thing that’s most disturbing is that they are passing on false information that the leftist media puts out. The fake news media has become an arm of the Democrats with their lies and distortions against the president.The hatefulness from the left is extreme. Here is just one of the photos posted below President Trump’s tweet. Can you imagine if the tables were turned and this was former President Obama?There are many more photos that are just as bad. Truly disgusting.Rush Limbaugh also had a message for Republicans in the Senate yesterday that is spot on:“If the Republicans do not get this vote taken and have Kavanaugh confirmed, you can kiss the midterms goodbye.” Rush LimbaughRush Limbaugh warned Republicans today that they need to get the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh through ASAP or they should pack up shop and go home…They will not win the midterms.He begins to talk about the Republicans at the 16:00 point of the video:TRANSCRIPT:So Chairman Grassley has a job to do here, because, if he gives Democrats enough time, they’ll produce a woman claiming to be Kavanaugh’s secret Russian wife who Trump paid to urinate on that bed in Moscow. If Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with the woman claiming to be Kavanaugh’s secret Russian wife. — he’s a bigamist, too, don’t you know — and Trump paid Kavanaugh’s second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes to urinate on the bed Obama slept in while in Moscow.If Grassley doesn’t get a handle on this and just do — and I’ll tell you something else, which everybody also knows.If the Republicans do not get this vote taken and have Kavanaugh confirmed, you can kiss the midterms goodbye.You can kiss goodbye holding the House and you can kiss goodbye holding the Senate. Because whatever the Democrats think of their base, the one thing I know that if you guys fold on this and cave and keep bending over backwards… You’ve done that enough. You’ve demonstrated that you don’t hate women.You’ve demonstrated that you’re open minded. You’ve demonstrated that you’re gonna hear from her. You’re never gonna hear from her! She’s never gonna show up. She’s not telling a story that can be verified, Senator Grassley. She’s not gonna show up. If you guys don’t conduct this vote in defiance of all this and if Avenatti gets one foot in the door to a Senate committee to start telling his story, then you can kind of kiss good-bye Republican chances in the midterms in November.

If Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with the woman claiming to be Kavanaugh’s secret Russian wife. — he’s a bigamist, too, don’t you know — and Trump paid Kavanaugh’s second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes to urinate on the bed Obama slept in while in Moscow.If Grassley doesn’t get a handle on this and just do — and I’ll tell you something else, which everybody also knows.If the Republicans do not get this vote taken and have Kavanaugh confirmed, you can kiss the midterms goodbye.You can kiss goodbye holding the House and you can kiss goodbye holding the Senate. Because whatever the Democrats think of their base, the one thing I know that if you guys fold on this and cave and keep bending over backwards… You’ve done that enough. You’ve demonstrated that you don’t hate women.You’ve demonstrated that you’re open minded. You’ve demonstrated that you’re gonna hear from her. You’re never gonna hear from her! She’s never gonna show up. She’s not telling a story that can be verified, Senator Grassley. She’s not gonna show up. If you guys don’t conduct this vote in defiance of all this and if Avenatti gets one foot in the door to a Senate committee to start telling his story, then you can kind of kiss good-bye Republican chances in the midterms in November.

That didn’t ever make sense either, right?Either way, here we are and Kavanaugh’s accuser had supposedly sent Diane Feinstein a confidential letter. Feinstein released Ford’s confidential and it’s all sorts of messed up.For starters, the font doesn’t match on parts of the letter. If you look closely at the second paragraph of Ford’s letter, then you’ll see a huge difference in the font. Why are the words using different fonts? Did someone try to change the original letter?If you’re typing an email or letter to someone, then you don’t randomly change the font in the middle of the document. No one does that. That wouldn’t make sense to randomly start using a different font. I don’t think elementary students would do something like that. Ford is educated, so we have to assume she has at least moderate computer skills and I’d like to think she wouldn’t change a font in the middle of a paper for no reason. That doesn’t add up and I find it suspicious.This looks like someone tried to change what the letter originally said, but couldn’t figure out what font to use.Heck, anyone using the paintbrush tool could’ve switched this letter.Then again, was the letter sent by email or was it printed and sent via snail mail?If it was sent via snail mail, then someone can still scan the letter and use software to manipulate the letter, however, the font and sizing may not match up perfectly. That’s kind of what this looks like. It looks like someone scanned a printed piece of paper and maybe uploaded it to something like Google Drive/Docs where it was converted, but unable to be perfectly matched.I don’t know about you, but this is very strange to me.Here’s the letter, thanks to the Gateway Pundit.BREAKING: In the original unreacted letter Feinstein finally gave to Grassley, the size of the font of first line of the second paragraph (""Brett Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted me during High School in the early 1980's"") is strangely larger than the rest of the text — Paul Sperry (@paulsperry_) September 24, 2018JUST IN: Senate Judiciary Cmte.

Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh should’ve been confirmed by now, but he’s being derailed by a massive campaign to delay his inevitable confirmation. I can’t tell if the Democrats are just pulling stall tactics in an attempt to get Kavanaugh to quit, or if they’re just doing a typical character assassination – or it’s both.Either way, people on the left side of politics are embracing politically motivated pathetic behavior and turning what used to be a simple procedure into a massive joke and it’s frankly embarrassing. Anyone paying attention to American politics has to be shaking their head in disbelief at the clown car carrying the Democrats around in their big shoes and fluffy red noses. It’s a clown act for sure, and not a good one.Trending: BREAKING: Man Claims He Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]When I said it just got more bizarre, that’s because activist groups and others organized a “walk out” today in support of Christine Blasey Ford and her accusations against Brett Kavanaugh. You would’ve thought the death threats that his family received was enough, but leave it to the attention-starved feminists to want a piece of the pie.take our poll - story continues belowWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

However, if not true, then his accuser should face jail time. False sexual assault charges should have the same punishment as the crime itself, and in this case, I fully believe that Ford and the Democrats have staged a major character dismantling hoping that he backs out of the confirmation. I reviewed as much information as I can, and if I was a judge, I’d throw her case out faster than a Nolan Ryan fastball.The “walk out” was organized by a group called Time’s Up. They posted a tweet that said “Survivors must be heard. Wear black and join the national walkout on Monday, Sept. 24 at 1 pm ET/10 am PT in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. https://www.facebook.com/events/2132578240149628/ … #BelieveSurvivors #TIMESUP”Survivors must be heard.

Ford’s allegations don’t have any merit to them and the people supporting her blindly all seem to be anti-Trump. I scanned through multiple accounts of people who joined in on the walk out and they all appeared to be very anti-Trump and feminist in appearance. By appearance, I don’t mean their physical appearance, but the presentation of their social media accounts in the sense that they support mostly Democratic information or share things from Democratic organizations like the Women’s March.I believe the people who are blindly believing Ford are mostly about hating Trump more than anything. I don’t see the same level of energy from them when it comes to accusations thrown at Democrats.This isn’t about supporting a rape survivor or someone who suffered through a really traumatic sexual assault experience, this is all about hating Trump and trying to disrupt anything he does.Anyone supporting a meritless accusation like what Ford has presented, with no evidence or anyone to support her story, is probably doing so because they dislike President Trump.We’re in a day and age where instead of looking for the facts behind Ford’s accusations, there are people who just blindly support her and I have a very strong feeling that it’s because they are all anti-Trumpers.I asked the Time’s Up account if they supported Juanita Broaddrick’s accusation that Bill Clinton raped her. No answer. I asked if they supported Karen Monahan’s allegations of abuse against Keith Ellison. No answer. I also asked if they supported Monica Lewinsky’s story against Bill Clinton. No answer. I asked them twice, no answer. Maybe they were busy or not online at the time, but I don’t expect an answer from them regardless.What do those three people have in common? Except for Lewinsky, the other two were basically ignored and brushed off like they were lint on a sweater. Monahan’s story against Ellison is currently active and she has evidence, but she can’t seem to get the same support as Ford, and Ford’s story seems to be getting made up as we go along.Why are the people who accuse Democrats of sexual assault being ignored? Why are big time Democrats ignoring this and allowing this behavior to happen on their end, but they’re pursuing a case by Ford that isn’t even worth talking about?Here are a few people/organizations who supported the irresponsible walk out or Ford in general.On my first day as a television director, I walked out along with my cast and crew in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and sexual abuse victims worldwide. #DearProfessorFord #metoo #TIMESUP pic.twitter.com/eTMvNWSVm8 — Krista Vernoff (@KristaVernoff) September 24, 2018We believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford — and we believe Deborah Ramirez.

This does not mean that all women who suffered through horrible incidents are telling lies, but some do.Like who?These two men after 26 years in prison over false rape accusations.This guy who was kicked out of college over false rape accusations.Two black men accused by a white woman of rape, also false accusations.This girl who said her ex-boyfriend raped her when he turned her down. He didn’t.This man who killed himself after false rape accusations.This man who spent 17 months in jail after a false rape accusation.There are many more men who had their lives ruined by women telling lies about rape.The actions of feminists using Ford’s flimsy accusation against Kavanaugh is a spit in the face of any real sexual assault victim.Feminists who walked out to blindly support Kavanaugh’s accuser should be exposed as politically charged frauds.Where is the support for other women who accuse Democrats of the same behaviors?Where is the support for the men who are falsely accused and have their lives ruined?No one should ever blindly accuse someone of a story without getting the facts straight, something Christine Blasey Ford just can’t seem to do."	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/walkout.jpge2e6fde5cfcc445eb57c854995daefb7	[]	2018-09-24 18:20:44-04:00	"JUST IN: BRETT AND ASHLEY KAVANAUGH Interviewed By Fox News: ""I'm not going anywhere.""

I then answered more questions at a confidential session. The followingweek, I responded to more than 1,200 written questions, more than have been submitted to allprevious Supreme Court nominees combined.Only after that exhaustive process was complete did I learn, through the news media, about a 36-year-old allegation from high school that had been asserted months earlier and withheld from me throughout the hearing process. First it was an anonymous allegation that I categorically andunequivocally denied. Soon after the accuser was identified, I repeated my denial on the recordand made clear that I wished to appear before the Committee. I then repeated my denial toCommittee investigators—under criminal penalties for false statements. All of the witnessesidentified by Dr. Ford as being present at the party she describes are on the record to theCommittee saying they have no recollection of any such party happening. I asked to testifybefore the Committee again under oath as soon as possible, so that both Dr. Ford and I couldboth be heard. I thank Chairman Grassley for scheduling that hearing for Thursday.Last night, another false and uncorroborated accusation from 35 years ago was published. Onceagain, those alleged to have been witnesses to the event deny it ever happened. There is now afrenzy to come up with something—anything—that will block this process and a vote on myconfirmation from occurring.These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse. But they are also athreat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obviouscharacter assassination—if allowed to succeed—will dissuade competent and good people of allpolitical persuasions from service.As I told the Committee during my hearing, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed bypublic or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.I have devoted my career to serving the public and the cause of justice, and particularly topromoting the equality and dignity of women. Women from every phase of my life have comeforward to attest to my character. I am grateful to them. I owe it to them, and to my family, todefend my integrity and my name. I look forward to answering questions from the Senate on Thursday.Sincerely,Brett M.

His wife and daughters are getting the bad end of the stick just as much as he is, with the entire family receiving violent and death threats ever since Christine Blasey Ford teamed up with the Democratic Party to throw wild accusations at Kavanaugh just before he’s confirmed into the Supreme Court.His wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, is receiving violent threats to her work email account. Heavy reported what the Wall Street Journal had stated about the threats, but that story requires people to pay, so we quoted them here for you: “The Journal reports that the emails came to Ashley Kavanaugh’s work email, both from the same email account. “May you, your husband and your kids burn in hell,” said one email, according to WSJ.

The Kavanaugh’s two young daughters, 10 and 13, are also receiving threats and everyone knows that the kids are off limits when it comes to things like this. It’s a battle between Christine Blasey Ford, her uncredible accusations, and Brett Kavanaugh – but his wife and kids should not be messed with. It’s despicable that someone would send another human being’s children death threats.It’s so bad that even Kellyanne Conway got involved and asked why the reporters aren’t covering the threats hurled at the children.Conway insisted that reporters cover the death threats made against the Kavanaugh family, in particular, the wife and daughters.The Daily Caller stated “Kellyanne, counselor to the president, said that the allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh are being “politicized” by Democrats and the media. “It’s not fair to Kavanaugh. It’s probably not fair to Dr. Ford. It’s also not fair to get so little coverage of all the vile language and death threats being thrown at Judge Kavanaugh’s family,” Kellyanne told reporters bluntly.“His young daughters, his wife don’t deserve that. He does not deserve that,” Kellyanne continued, “None of you deserve it. He really needs to tone down the temperature that way. Lot of people are attacking him and his family and it’s awful. It’s awful.”Chairman Grassley was one of the many to call this out, as per a tweet “BREAKING: Chairman Grassley reveals Judge Kavanaugh’s two young daughters have faced serious death threats “and vicious assaults as a result of these allegations” — and “they’re getting worse by the day.”BREAKING: Chairman Grassley reveals Judge Kavanaugh's two young daughters have faced serious death threats ""and vicious assaults as a result of these allegations"" — and ""they're getting worse by the day."" — Paul Sperry (@paulsperry_) September 24, 2018It should be reported that Christine Blasey Ford is receiving threats as well. As it stands, both the Kavanaugh’s and Ford’s are receiving death threats and everything has turned into a media-frenzy circus act just dripping with juvenile delinquency and violence sparked by the media and their ability to heighten the fake outrage. You know who is benefiting right now? The Democrats as they likely smear Kavanaugh’s name just to stall the confirmation and cause problems for President Trump.You have to wonder one thing – if someone else was president and nominated Judge Kavanaugh, then would the Democrats still be acting like circus performers in their huge distraction? Or would the confirmation go through smoothly as many others have in the past?This is absolutely preposterous and anyone threatening Kavanaugh’s daughters and wife should be ashamed of themselves.Will the mainstream media look further into this and help prosecute the people who are sending embarrassinghreats?I cannot believe such a simple procedure such as confirming someone into the Supreme Court has turned into such a circus act.The Democratic Party is embarassing to the government, and perhaps all of America right now. Please stop with the threats and the name-smearing and start acting like adults.Kids don’t deserve to be threatened and it’s shameful that people are doing it.This level of insufferable and generic nonsense just isn’t normal."	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kavs.jpg75b659c88c3e4945bf95a3597e10c2ec	[]	2018-09-24 16:03:34-04:00	"JUST IN: CNN's JIM ACOSTA Gets Slammed by Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo for Asking About Invoking The 25th Amendment: ""Absurd"" [Video] * 100PercentFedUp.com"	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	"JUST IN: CNN's JIM ACOSTA Gets Slammed by Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo for Asking About Invoking The 25th Amendment: ""Absurd"" [Video] * 100PercentFedUp.com"	0	"This is the best tag team ever!

He did say that there was no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment. A very strategic answer dodging key items he’s being accused of. This was all happening in May of 2017 right after Comey was fired.Rosenstein denies the NYT claim:“The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect,” he said in a statement. “I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.The New York Times reported:The deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, suggested last year that he secretly record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration, and he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office for being unfit.Mr. Rosenstein made these suggestions in the spring of 2017 when Mr. Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director plunged the White House into turmoil. Over the ensuing days, the president divulged classified intelligence to Russians in the Oval Office, and revelations emerged that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to pledge loyalty and end an investigation into a senior aide.Mr. Rosenstein was just two weeks into his job. He had begun overseeing the Russia investigation and played a key role in the president’s dismissal of Mr. Comey by writing a memo critical of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But Mr. Rosenstein was caught off guard when Mr. Trump cited the memo in the firing, and he began telling people that he feared he had been used.Mr. Rosenstein made the remarks about secretly recording Mr. Trump and about the 25th Amendment in meetings and conversations with other Justice Department and F.B.I. officials. Several people described the episodes, insisting on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The people were briefed either on the events themselves or on memos written by F.B.I. officials, including Andrew G. McCabe, then the acting bureau director, that documented Mr. Rosenstein’s actions and comments.The entire report by The New York Times here.Sara Carter tweeted out support for Trump firing Rosenstein:The evidence in these memos from fired FBI Deputy Dir Andrew McCabe about DAG Rosenstein is enough for @realDonaldTrump to fire him and launch an investigation.

We know first hand what Facebook censorship looks like…our pro-Trump 100 Percent FED UP Facebook page with almost 2 million followers was unpublished by Facebook only 10 days before the 2016 election. Prior to the election, we were receiving over 32 million views per week on our Facebook page by mostly conservatives who were looking for real news about Donald Trump and his campaign, without the liberal bias (hate). When Breitbart News asked Facebook why our page was unpublished without notice, they simply replied that it was a “mistake”, and within 24 hours, our 100 Percent FED UP Facebook page was republished.Following the stunning election of Donald J. Trump in 2016, conservative pages on Facebook saw a dramatic drop in traffic. Immediately following President Trump’s inauguration, the traffic on our 100 Percent FED UP took a huge nosedive. Over the next year, we watched our Facebook traffic take a 88% hit in traffic. Top executives and underlings at Google, Facebook, and Twitter were shaken to the core. Many of them have been caught on video having meltdowns over the election or discussing how they will combat Trump by using their platform. Democrats blamed Hillary’s loss on Facebook, citing Russian interference on social media, of course, they were referring to the measly $100,000 in Russian ads that Facebook allowed to run on their platform. The Facebook ads that Democrats asserted affected the outcome of the election, were proven to be directed at dividing citizens of the United States and were not intended to support or criticize Clinton or Trump. In 2016, Facebook reportedly collected over $26 billion in ad revenue.And now, for the most underreported story of the decade…Trending: BREAKING: Man Who Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]Last year, during a Personal Democracy Forum in New York City, Barack Obama’s digital director, Carol Davidsen dropped a stunning admission about how Mark Zuckerberg gave the data for the ENTIRE SOCIAL NETWORK of the U.S. to the Democrat Party.take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

During the forum, Davidsen shockingly, admitted that Facebook gave the Democrat Party the ability to ingest the entire social network of the U.S. that’s on Facebook, “which is most people”. Davidsen told the audience, “Where this gets complicated is that freaked Facebook out, right? So they shut off the feature. Well, the Republicans never built an app to do that. So, the data’s out there. You can’t take it back, right? So the Democrats have this information. So, when they look at a voter file, and someone comes to them, they can immediately be like, ‘Oh, here are all of the other people that they know, and here are the people that they can help us persuade because they’re really good friends with this person.’ The Republicans do not have this information, and will not get that information.” Davidsen confessed, ” I’m a Democrat, so you know, maybe I could argue that maybe that’s a good thing. But really, it’s not in the overall process, right? So, that wasn’t thought all the way through, and now there’s a disadvantage of information, that seems unfair. But I’m not Facebook, so these are the realities.” Davidsen’s speech was asked by the organizers to leave the stage early. She appears to be stunned after she got the “hook” from the leftist group, and later tweeted: I start talking about Facebook at around minute 18, and had more to say, before getting dragged off stage because i didn’t understand the clock in the back of the room. HaWatch the incredible exchange here:Over the past year, executives from Facebook and Twitter have appeared before Congress to discuss the censorship of conservative voices on their platforms. They’ve all made promises to look into censorship practices, yet the censorship of conservatives by all 3 tech giants continues.Finally, members of Congress appear to be waking up to the very real and serious consequences of allowing the top disseminators of news in the world to silence conservative voices, and that includes Google. Last week, a video was released by Breitbart News revealing top Google executives openly discussing their panic and frustration after Hillary lost the 2016 presidential election. President Trump’s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted about the video and demanded that Congress hold hearings to investigate:@ google needs to explain why this isn’t a threat to the Republic. Watch the video. Google believes they can shape your search results and videos to make you “have their values”. Open borders. Socialism. Medicare 4 all. Congressional hearings! Investigate https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1039980750500704261Today, GOP Representatives Steve Scalise and Cathy McMorris Rodgers put Facebook, Twitter, and Google on notice in a USA Today op-ed:Add Google to the list of tech companies who owe the American people answers. A leaked video of Google executives surfaced recently that depicts them lamenting the 2016 election outcome. Google co-founder Sergey Brin told employees that he found the election “deeply offensive.” It is clear that left-leaning political bias exists among senior employees at Google. The question remains: How do their personal biases affect their products and choices? The House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg this year to have a transparent discussion about fair and free platforms for the battle of ideas. As members of the committee, we asked questions that Americans are concerned about regarding content bias, harassment, hate speech allegations and personal data privacy. Dorsey was asked why Twitter quickly banned Rep. Marsha Blackburn’s Senatorial campaign announcement due to its pro-life message because it was deemed by the company as an “inflammatory statement that was likely to cause a strong negative reaction.” Dorsey apologized and admitted that it was a mistake that his company later corrected. Similarly, after seeing a number of examples of content discrimination, we asked Zuckerberg for answers on how Facebook will ensure that content is judged objectively, without bias based on religious or political ideology. The American people deserve to know the process and bias involved in algorithms and human content managers who screen content if these tech giants will be able to restore confidence that they are not discriminating against people based on their political views. We look forward to the outcome of Facebook’s audit and appreciate their ongoing commitment to seriously looking at these issues.Congress would like to give the tech giants the opportunity to prove they can be transparent and that they are not censoring conservatives before they take legislative action, warning that it would be “dangerous” for Congress to get involved in what speech is acceptable on these platforms”.Silicon Valley should make the first move on reform However, we must be very careful to not create laws and regulations that overstep government’s role and ultimately cause more problems than they solve. Regulation would likely enshrine the current internet ecosystem and result in stifling future competition to current tech giants. It is also dangerous for Congress to get involved in deciding what speech is acceptable on these platforms. Defining political speech or hate speech a certain way in law can have unintended consequences that may permanently damage a fair and free marketplace of ideas.Isn’t it more dangerous for the top disseminators of news in the world to punish anyone who doesn’t hold their far-left views, by prioritizing and pushing their own leftist agenda on unsuspecting users?"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/censored-Facebook-google-twitter-1200x630.jpgcb496dec9505461ba36854c989619159	[]	2018-09-24 14:29:27-04:00	"JUST IN: JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH Releases Strong Statement to Senate Judiciary Committee…”I Will Not Be Intimidated"" * 100PercentFedUp.com"	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	"JUST IN: JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH Releases Strong Statement to Senate Judiciary Committee…”I Will Not Be Intimidated"" * 100PercentFedUp.com"	0	"“I will not be intimidated” – Judge Brett KavanaughJudge Brett Kavanaugh just released a strong statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding accusations against him from decades ago…Committee on the Judiciary Committee on the JudiciaryUnited States Senate United States Senate135 Hart Senate Office Building 331 Hart Senate Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20510 Washington, D.C. 20510Trending: BREAKING: Man Who Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein:take our poll - story continues belowWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

I then answered more questions at a confidential session. The followingweek, I responded to more than 1,200 written questions, more than have been submitted to allprevious Supreme Court nominees combined.Only after that exhaustive process was complete did I learn, through the news media, about a 36-year-old allegation from high school that had been asserted months earlier and withheld from me throughout the hearing process. First it was an anonymous allegation that I categorically andunequivocally denied. Soon after the accuser was identified, I repeated my denial on the recordand made clear that I wished to appear before the Committee. I then repeated my denial toCommittee investigators—under criminal penalties for false statements. All of the witnessesidentified by Dr. Ford as being present at the party she describes are on the record to theCommittee saying they have no recollection of any such party happening. I asked to testifybefore the Committee again under oath as soon as possible, so that both Dr. Ford and I couldboth be heard. I thank Chairman Grassley for scheduling that hearing for Thursday.Last night, another false and uncorroborated accusation from 35 years ago was published. Onceagain, those alleged to have been witnesses to the event deny it ever happened. There is now afrenzy to come up with something—anything—that will block this process and a vote on myconfirmation from occurring.These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse. But they are also athreat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obviouscharacter assassination—if allowed to succeed—will dissuade competent and good people of allpolitical persuasions from service.As I told the Committee during my hearing, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed bypublic or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.I have devoted my career to serving the public and the cause of justice, and particularly topromoting the equality and dignity of women. Women from every phase of my life have comeforward to attest to my character. I am grateful to them. I owe it to them, and to my family, todefend my integrity and my name. I look forward to answering questions from the Senate on Thursday.Sincerely,Brett M.

He’s facing one of the biggest character assassinations that I can ever remember in a what appears to be a massive smear campaign by Democrats looking to undermine the work of President Trump and basically attack anyone he selects for just about anything.This guy can’t catch a break and he’s being dragged into a huge mess that all appears to be a big project by Democrats to take him down. Of course, it seems that way based on the evidence and incidents going on thus far. Everything with Christine Blasey Ford, that other accuser (whose name I left out because there’s nothing credible in her story, even less credible than Ford’s), and the Democratic Party seem to be attempting to push Kavanaugh to the edge in hopes that he quits or they turn a few confirmation votes against him.Trending: BREAKING: Man Who Grew Up Near Julie Swetnick’s Family Says She Is “Delusional Whack Job” Who Had “Substance Abuse” and “Mental Health” issues [LISTEN]Now the police department in Maryland’s Montgomery County is getting involved and they’ve issued a statement on what’s going on.take our poll - story continues belowWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

The Department recognizes that victims of sexual assault may not want to involve law enforcement and/or initiate a criminal investigation, and we respect that position. The Department, however, stands prepared to assist anyone who reports being the victim of a sexual assault. Typically, in a sexual assault case, the cooperation of the victim or witnesses is necessary. As with any criminal investigation, a determination must be made as to the jurisdiction where the alleged offense occurred and the specific details of the event to establish a potential criminal charge. Our Department is ready to investigate any claim of sexual assault that is alleged to have occurred within our County.Here’s where that gets murky. If there’s an accusation of sexual assault, then why did Christine Blasey Ford go to Diane Feinstein instead of the police? If there’s a second accuser, then why didn’t that person go to the police? Sounds a bit weird, right?Here is the police department, the one likely to receive the call, who is saying that 1) no one has filed any reports of said alleged crimes, and 2) they’re ready to do the work if needed.This is why we cannot just outright believe someone’s accusations from that many years ago without substantial evidence. Had there been a police report from three decades ago, then there would be something concrete that people could utilize. But there’s nothing. There is just the word of the accuser vs the word of the accused, and right about now the accused is looking very innocent.Based on everything that’s going on with Ford and her accusations and her inability to locate a credible witness who supports her claims, there’s just nothing going on there that’s worth looking at Kavanaugh differently.How can you destroy a man’s character with wild accusations like this?Based on the lack of evidence and what looks to be a massive character take-down plot by the Democrats, I can only imagine this circus gets more bizarre before someone finally shuts the door and proceeds with the confirmation of Kavanaugh.Bill Cosby was found guilty for crimes done many years ago, but how many actual witnesses were there? Quite a few. It’s one thing to have that many people telling the same story about his alleged sexual misconduct and it’s easier to find him guilty.However, Christine Blasey Ford is just one person with a slightly shakey story, no witnesses, and basically no one to vouch for her story that it even happened. Her collaboration with Democrats puts an extra damper on it as well.I don’t know about you, but when someone commits a crime, then I would call the police – not the politicians 30+ years later.Calling the police makes sense.Calling a politician does not.What’s really going on here?"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kavpolice.jpgda920b1883504b41914cae215369378d	[]	2018-09-24 13:19:34-04:00	JUST IN: SARAH SANDERS Releases Statement On Deputy AG Rosenstein * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	JUST IN: SARAH SANDERS Releases Statement On Deputy AG Rosenstein * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders just released a statement regarding Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein:“At the request of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he and President Trump had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories.

Carter (@SaraCarterDC) September 21, 2018Last week, radio host Mark Levin warned fellow conservatives that they should not rush to conclusions about the New York Times‘ latest story alleging that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had plotted against President Donald Trump.He warned that Trump’s enemies might be trying to goad him into firing Rosenstein before the midterm elections by leaking information from memoranda created by former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired in March for lying.The Times reported Friday that in 2017, Rosenstein had suggested recording Trump secretly, and had “discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office for being unfit.” Rosenstein denied the latter claim, and Department of Justice sources suggested that Rosenstein had been speaking sarcastically about wearing a wire in meetings with Trump — in response, Levin said, citing sources, to McCabe’s animus against the president.Levin also said the story illuminated why, and how, Rosenstein had appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller. “This also tells me why Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel,” Levin explained. “He should never have appointed a special counsel, he violated his own department rules, there was no criminal predicate. But he was being pressed by the deputy director of the FBI.’” –Breitbart“Col Mac” has the best solution yet:.#RodRosenstein has offered to resign! @realDonaldTrump should not accept resignation and instead fire his corrupt ass…strip that government pension and set yet another example #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp — ""Col Mac"" (@jmac999) September 24, 2018.#RodRosenstein has offered to resign! @realDonaldTrump should not accept resignation and instead fire his corrupt ass…strip that government pension and set yet another example #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rosenstein-1200x630.jpg550ade1869454caebdb17637d40194a1	[]	2018-09-24 10:19:36-04:00	"JUST IN: New York Times REFUSED To Run Second Kavanaugh Accuser’s Story…”Ms Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates""…Told Classmates “SHE COULDN’T BE CERTAIN” Kavanaugh Was Person She Was Acc"	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	"JUST IN: New York Times REFUSED To Run Second Kavanaugh Accuser’s Story…”Ms Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates""…Told Classmates “SHE COULDN’T BE CERTAIN” Kavanaugh Was Person She Was Acc"	0	"take our poll - story continues belowThe woman at the center of the story, Deborah Ramirez, who is fifty-three, attended Yale with Kavanaugh, where she studied sociology and psychology. Later, she spent years working for an organization that supports victims of domestic violence. The New Yorker contacted Ramirez after learning of her possible involvement in an incident involving Kavanaugh.Ramirez said that, when both she and Kavanaugh were freshmen at Yale, she was invited by a friend on the women’s soccer team to a dorm-room party. She recalled that the party took place in a suite at Lawrance Hall, in the part of Yale known as Old Campus, and that a small group of students decided to play a drinking game together. “We were sitting in a circle,” she said. “People would pick who drank.” Ramirez was chosen repeatedly, she said, and quickly became inebriated. At one point, she said, a male student pointed a gag plastic penis in her direction. Later, she said, she was on the floor, foggy and slurring her words, as that male student and another stood nearby. (Ramirez identified the two male onlookers, but, at her request, The New Yorker is not naming them.)A third male student then exposed himself to her. “I remember a penis being in front of my face,” she said. “I knew that’s not what I wanted, even in that state of mind.” She recalled remarking, “That’s not a real penis,” and the other students laughing at her confusion and taunting her, one encouraging her to “kiss it.” She said that she pushed the person away, touching it in the process. Ramirez, who was raised a devout Catholic, in Connecticut, said that she was shaken. “I wasn’t going to touch a penis until I was married,” she said. “I was embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.” She remembers Kavanaugh standing to her right and laughing, pulling up his pants. “Brett was laughing,” she said. “I can still see his face, and his hips coming forward, like when you pull up your pants.” She recalled another male student shouting about the incident. “Somebody yelled down the hall, ‘Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie’s face,’ ” she said. “It was his full name. I don’t think it was just ‘Brett.’ And I remember hearing and being mortified that this was out there.”Ramirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the evening, and that, if she ever presents her story to the F.B.I. or members of the Senate, she will inevitably be pressed on her motivation for coming forward after so many years, and questioned about her memory, given her drinking at the party."	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ramirez-kavanaugh-1200x630.jpg718e8e1bdceb4a109cebff0a2c5bd071	[]	2018-09-23 18:05:02-04:00	BREAKING: KAVANAUGH HAS NEW EVIDENCE From 1982 That May DESTROY Ford's Accusations * 100PercentFedUp.com	http://100PercentFedUp.com/	US	BREAKING: KAVANAUGH HAS NEW EVIDENCE From 1982 That May DESTROY Ford's Accusations * 100PercentFedUp.com	0	"Breaking news reports are stating that Judge Brett Kavanaugh has calendars from 1982 that he will use to help deny the accusations against him made by Christine Blasey Ford.

One example is Keith Ellison who faces accusations that he abused his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan. She reportedly has a 911 call and documentation to prove her claims, but many Democrats are completely ignoring her and refusing to look into their own party member.Another double standard is Senator Cory Booker who once groped a woman’s breast and even admitted to it, however, where is the outrage on that?Keith Ellison and Cory Booker are two instances where there’s clearly more evidence or a confession, but little outrage. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh’s story has just about no evidence or witnesses, so why are more people harping on this allegation instead of the more serious ones?A huge double standard mixed with a wicked character assassination seems to be what we have here.How much longer will it be tolerated?"	https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/brett.jpg98bb298664ae42c0bbf8bc99126cc083	[]		News	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	News	0	Plenty of companies are happy to play it safe when it comes to their marketing strategies, but the maker of one of…	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--pCXPrN3k--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/mogcjp3kihx7oyz31doa.png9b63192296e1433b96b8878c0557593e	[]		Get Ready To Key His Car: 5 Signs Your Boyfriend Is Constipated Behind Your Back	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Get Ready To Key His Car: 5 Signs Your Boyfriend Is Constipated Behind Your Back	0	"Every healthy relationship is built on a foundation of trust, so if your partner isn’t really as regular as he claims to be, it’s best that you find out now and move on. If any of these signs sound familiar, there’s a good chance your boyfriend is guilty of being constipated behind your back.1. He’d rather stay in and eat prunes than go out to eatIt’s easy to talk your way around this one and come up with excuses for why this is no big deal, but there’s no denying the obvious. If your boyfriend would rather stay in on the weekend eating bowls full of prunes than take you out somewhere special, it’s very likely because eating anything substantial makes him nauseous and he’s hoping prunes will get his system moving. This is textbook behavior for someone who’s hiding the fact that he’s constipated, and you should be wary.Advertisement2. He’s started following a lot of gastroenterologists on social mediaCheck his Instagram, Facebook, Twitter—check it all. If your boyfriend has been liking and commenting on dozens of intestinal doctors’ social media posts, then he’s almost certainly being constipated on the sly, and he’s practically begging to get caught. Ask yourself this: Would your boyfriend be so interested in gastroenterology if he were having regular bowel movements? Probably not. Time to dump his clogged-up ass.3. He’s no longer interested in sex because he’s “exhausted from shitting throughout the day”This is an all too common excuse from lying boyfriends who are constipated behind their partner’s back. By making it seem like he’s shitting with such regularity and vigor that he has no physical energy for anything else, he’s cleverly distracting you from the real cause of his lack of bedroom passion, which is that his struggles with stool production frequently leave him too uneasy and bloated for lovemaking. Don’t put up with his lies. Key the asshole’s car and move on with your life.Advertisement4. He has a lot of constipated friendsBirds of a feather... well, you know the saying. If your boyfriend is always hanging around with guys who hardly ever take a dump, odds are he’s constipated, too. If your guy’s friends are always going on about how rarely they have satisfying bowel movements while he sits there biting his lip nervously, there’s your sign. Guys who take big healthy dumps throughout the day don’t hang out with backed-up dudes, and don’t let your man convince you otherwise.5. You’ve caught him asleep on the toiletIf you catch your boyfriend sleeping on the toilet, don’t listen to any of his bullshit excuses, because there is only one possible explanation: He was sitting on the toilet trying to void his bowels for so long that he eventually just dozed off. He is constipated, and you’ve caught him red-handed. So don’t lie to yourself, and whatever you do, don’t give him the benefit of doubt. It’s hard, but you need to accept that he’s a constipated son of a bitch, and you need to leave his sorry ass before he wastes any more of your time. You deserve someone who respects you and is willing to communicate openly and honestly with you about their shitting habits, and you shouldn’t settle for anything less. Find yourself someone who shits like a real man and don’t look back. You won’t regret it."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--YFKAgqwT--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/tru2g2rolwxgbhcltzmr.jpgffc4660a037e44bfbef29d0525c29242	[]		Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far With Its Episode Where Ernie Microwaves Himself While The Words ‘NO LESSON TODAY’ Flash On-Screen?	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far With Its Episode Where Ernie Microwaves Himself While The Words ‘NO LESSON TODAY’ Flash On-Screen?	0	"Sesame Street has been delighting and educating children for decades, but the beloved show may have crossed the line yesterday with a controversial creative decision that has some parents furious. Did Sesame Street go too far with its episode where Ernie microwaves himself while the words “NO LESSON TODAY” flashed on the screen?Within minutes of airing, hundreds of parents took to social media to express their anger over the contentious episode, which featured an hour-long sequence where Ernie walks into an empty kitchen, looks directly into the camera, and says, “Here’s my golden moment,” before climbing into the microwave, setting the timer for six hours, and shutting the door. Children had a full view of Ernie’s body rotating in the microwave while the words “NO LESSON TODAY” flashed on the screen.

This is what true courage looks like!When Stephen Brewster noticed a three-story residential building engulfed in flame during his morning jog, he ignored the terror so many of us would feel in that situation and fearlessly charged right up outside the burning home. All it took was seeing the blazing roof and hearing panicked shouts from inside for Brewster to sprint over and stop 15 feet in front of the building’s door, and his incredible bravery kept him rooted firmly in place no matter how large the fire continued to grow. As smoke poured out the windows and sparks shot into the sky, Brewster’s courage never wavered—he stood directly in front of the raging inferno despite having no professional firefighting experience whatsoever, only pure determination and iron-willed grit.You just can’t fake that kind of moxie!“I had been totally paralyzed just watching the fire, and right as I was starting to worry that nobody was coming to help, out of nowhere this amazing guy comes tearing down the street and runs right up to the curb in front of the building,” said Jenna Daley, a neighbor who was lucky enough to witness Brewster’s heroic feat firsthand. For all eight nail-biting minutes it took for the fire department to show up, Brewster stood his ground out front with awe-inspiring mettle, bravely putting himself only yards away from the fire’s blistering heat and choking fumes. Even after the town’s fire trucks finally arrived on the scene, Brewster decided to see his job through to the end, and continued standing in front of the house until the last of the flames were finally extinguished.Bravo, Mr. Brewster! Your dauntless courage in running right up to a blazing house fire and standing immediately outside is a shining example to us all."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--s7-X7nt7--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/gm4ijg3ynplhdbukbvpe.jpgba5116d50175449896db4fc9d68ae212	[]		Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far With Its Episode Where Ernie Microwaves Himself While The Words ‘NO LESSON TODAY’ Flash On-Screen?	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far With Its Episode Where Ernie Microwaves Himself While The Words ‘NO LESSON TODAY’ Flash On-Screen?	0	"Sesame Street has been delighting and educating children for decades, but the beloved show may have crossed the line yesterday with a controversial creative decision that has some parents furious.

We’re sorry to announce that this story is no exception. Here’s a bleak reminder that the world is often a cruel, unjust place: The thing you want is all the way over there.Simply heartbreaking. This is the type of terrible tragedy you hear about happening to other people but never imagined actually happening to yourself.AdvertisementTragically, even though the thing you want is something you’d like to have right now, the heartbreaking reality is that in order to get it, you would have to get up and go all the way over there, which is enough to make you question whether going on living is even worth it at this point. This horrible situation forces us to question how a just and loving God could allow the thing you want to be in one place and have you be in a different place, even though you’d like the thing to be in the same place as you since you want it.In dark times like these, the love and support of friends and family are about all that can help pull you through the feelings of hopelessness and despair.All the more devastating, experts have confirmed that reaching your arm all the way out toward the thing you want will not be enough to get the thing you want to be in your hands, which is a truly devastating blow for you since you want the thing. Getting up and going to go get the thing is reportedly the only way the thing you want is ever going to be with you over where you are right now. And as if this world hadn’t already been cruel enough, it appears as though the thing you want will tauntingly remain clearly in your field of vision, leaving you to wonder what it might be like if the thing was closer to you, and making it nearly impossible for you to ever fully move on and live your life without thinking about having the thing in your hands.AdvertisementAt this point, all you can do is accept that you are now living in a world where the thing you want is all the way over there, and unless someone comes walking into the room who you can shout at and ask to bring the thing over to you, you’re going to have to learn to live without it or stand up and go all the way over there and get it. Either way, the awful task placed upon you by this cold and uncaring universe is to now pick up the shattered pieces of your life and try to move forward."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--O154a9Vf--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/bo5xporfbrzu0wpki4ee.jpgc157db8b546248cda49cec2318541554	[]		Exciting For Them: A Team Of Archaeologists Has Just Uncovered A Rock That Kind Of Looks Like Their Friend	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Exciting For Them: A Team Of Archaeologists Has Just Uncovered A Rock That Kind Of Looks Like Their Friend	0	"In a discovery that won’t have much significance for the world at large but is really cool for the people involved, a team of archeologists from Oxford University announced today that they had discovered a rock that kind of looks like their friend.Nice! This is such an exciting discovery for anyone who knows the guy these archeologists are talking about.Advertisement“While excavating the remains of a Bronze Age village on the southern coast of Norway, our researchers discovered an 800-year-old igneous rock that looks almost exactly like our friend Jason, which we thought was pretty dang neat,” reads the report, which was published yesterday in the Journal Of World Prehistory under the title “On The Extraction And Sustained Chemical And Compositional Analysis Of Cool Rock That Looks Like Our Buddy Jason.” “While the rock in question has very little significance from a geological or historical standpoint, there is strong evidence that anyone who knows Jason is going to take one look at it and be absolutely tickled by how much it looks like him.”Wow! To a very limited number of people, this is a seriously cool discovery.While experts in the field largely agree that this will have no effect on archaeology in any way, they all express their sincere congratulations to these lucky Oxford researchers for finding a rock that looks so much like a guy they know.

Alexandria’s always wearing stylish clothes—don’t you want to wear something like what she picked out? Her dress has more fabric than the one you tried on from Bebe, and the price is more reasonable, too. I know you liked that Bebe one, but I think it was a little low-cut. Maybe it would have looked okay with a camisole underneath it. You’re going to wear some pantyhose under your dress, right?2. NatalieAdvertisementNatalie had such a pretty dress that she wore to your Sweet 16, don’t you remember? That navy one that went to her knee with the tie in the back. That looked nice. Not like that Nicole girl whose dress basically looked painted on. I mean, she wasn’t leaving too much to the imagination. And by the way, those pumps you tried to pick out aren’t going to be comfortable. What about some nice kitten heels, like the ones Natalie wore? Natalie’s cool. If they’re good enough for Natalie, I don’t understand why you have such a problem with them.3. OliviaAdvertisementOlivia’s mom sent me a picture of her dress, and it has some nice cap sleeves that I think would really suit you. I like the way Olivia does her makeup, too. Nothing too dramatic. Why don’t you try that instead of all that eyeliner you sometimes wear? And speaking of Olivia, her dad said that he was going to drive some of the girls to the bowling alley after the dance is done, and then from there everyone can watch a movie in their den. Wouldn’t that be fun? Her mom said she was going to get snacks and everything, and some nail polish and spa stuff for you girls to use.4. Mrs. WeltyAdvertisementThe faculty chaperones are dressing up too, and I think Mrs. Welty’s dress is perfect. She showed it to me in the parking lot after the PTA meeting. You know, knee-length dresses are actually more flattering than shorter dresses are. They look good on everyone’s figure. Why don’t you think about wearing something that covers a little more skin?5. KerryAdvertisementKerry’s dress has long sleeves. She’s going to have a great time. And it’s not the kind of dress where the sleeves go down further than the hem, like what your brother’s homecoming date wore a few years ago. Boys can tell, you know, when girls are just looking for attention. That’s the way it is. Why don’t you try on one of my dresses? We can get that maroon one taken in if you want.

Our economy is tilted in favor of millionaires and billionaires, thanks to unfair laws that let plutocrats exploit their workers and pay almost nothing in taxes. Unless we take immediate action to fix income inequality, it’s clear that America’s middle class will disappear like the scientists who are erased from existence after the Clone-otaur alters the timeline of the universe in my un-produced screenplay Chronotaur 3: Hoof Of History.The culprit is trickle-down economics, the phony theory that if we simply hand more cash to the ultra-rich they’ll somehow create good jobs, the way a sinister cloning program uses stolen DNA from the Chronotaur to create an evil genetic doppelgänger known and feared as the Clone-otaur. Moviegoers will be familiar with the Chronotaur from the previous films in the Chronotaur trilogy, Chronotaur: Labyrinth Of Time and Chronotaur 2: Thread Of Destiny, as soon as my scripts are optioned by studios and released in theaters everywhere, but one thing viewers might be surprised to learn is that the richest 1 percent of Americans now own as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent combined. Yep, income inequality has gotten that bad.AdvertisementCongress should be trying to fix this obscene disparity, but to please their donors politicians instead pass tax cuts for the rich while slashing social services. As a result, the wealth gap continues to grow like a Clone-otaur fetus floating inside a cloning tank, lowering the standard of living for working-class families just so millionaires can afford a second mansion.Fortunately, the solution to income inequality isn’t as complicated as the Time Maze, the infinite extra-dimensional labyrinth patrolled by the Chronotaur that can be used to reach any coordinate in space-time by those capable of navigating its ever-shifting corridors. We must split the economic pie so that the rich pay their fair share of taxes, the way Dr. Raymond Childress and his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Childress, evenly divided their lifespans at the end of Chronotaur 2, and in doing so managed to postpone but not prevent the predestined, fatal car crash that Raymond initially time-traveled to alter in Labyrinth Of Time. Although the scientist couple dies during the gripping opening scene of Chronotaur 3, splitting their lifespan energy bought them an extra 20 years together, two decades as blissful as the well-paying jobs that once sustained a robust middle class.What ever happened to the American dream? Today it’s increasingly out of reach for most people to own a home, retire at a reasonable age, or raise your daughter into a strong female protagonist like Virginia Childress, a beautiful, brilliant, and empowered MIT grad student that movie audiences will immediately connect with.AdvertisementAfter the deaths of her parents, Virginia inherits their shares of Quantum Consortium stock and takes over her father’s position as CEO of the company. Under the wise leadership of Virginia’s father, the once-nefarious Quantum Consortium had been reformed into an ethical institute for time research, ceasing its misguided attempts to kill the Chronotaur in order to change the past without interference from the half-bovine cosmic guardian.It’s important to remember that in the 1950s the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent on income over $300,000, and this high tax rate encouraged corporations to reinvest their profits into paying employees a living wage rather than gifting lavish bonuses to executives like Virginia, who secretly worries that she cannot live up to her parents’ impressive legacy. Sadly, in the 1980s the Reagan administration enacted supply-side economic policies that gradually eroded American prosperity, leading us to the mess we’re in today.The GOP pretends that high taxes on the rich are as terrifying as the tagline “Double the Chronotaur. Infinity-times the horror,” when in fact progressive taxation is what allowed the middle class to flourish.AdvertisementIn our new gilded age, corporate moguls pocket most of the profits while leaving only scraps for the workers that actually created that wealth. When billionaires are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries, it doesn’t take a mysterious transmission from deep within the Time Maze warning you to investigate the file for Project Chronosome on the Quantum Consortium’s encrypted server to tell you that something is seriously wrong with this picture. After hacking her way into the computer, Virginia discovers that a rogue faction within the consortium, led by the beautiful but wicked chrono-geneticist Sirena LeMort, has been covertly working for years to spawn the Clone-otaur.Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Republicans continue to insist that a “rising tide lifts all boats.” Well, right now the only boats are one-percenters’ yachts, and middle-class Americans are left floundering in the water like Virginia desperately fighting to stop the Clone-otaur from being unleashed.To get a better understanding of the way the Reagan administration’s policies of deregulated markets led to the staggering income inequality we’re faced with today, take a look at these pages from Chronotaur 3:AdvertisementMy point is that if the Robo-Chronotaur can learn the error of its ways over eons of algorithmic contemplation, then why does America keep repeating the disproven tactic of trickle-down economics?You’d think that Republicans wouldn’t get re-elected when their tax cuts fail to help constituents, but they’re kept in office by keeping voters as misinformed as Virginia when she can’t tell the Chronotaur and Clone-otaur apart as they tussle. Just like middle-class American voters, Virginia accidentally shoots the Chronotaur by mistake with a photonic entanglement bazooka. This disperses the Chronotaur’s lifespan energy, making him too elderly and feeble to fight, and shatters the universe into hundreds of parallel realities called the Impossiworlds, where the laws of chance are askew and the only thing that is probable is the improbable, which is quite similar to how America is now more divided than ever.Sadly, many working-class Republicans have been tricked into voting against their own best interests, like foolish movie studios that pass on a trilogy of screenplays even though they’re surefire hits that would blow up at the box office.AdvertisementIt seems absurd that a poor coal miner in Appalachia could believe that they’d benefit from tax breaks for fat-cat tycoons, or that the Impossiworlds are each themed after different genres of fiction, but as the Fate Cow explains to Virginia, “Once the constraints of physics crumble away, every dream and nightmare will be made flesh.” Each pocket dimension is ruled over by a twisted version of the Chronotaur formed from a fragment of its divided lifespan energy, including the 1920s-mobster dimension ruled by the Crime-otaur, the medieval dimension ruled by the Crownotaur, the zombie-apocalypse dimension ruled by the Corpse-otaur, the pirate dimension ruled by the Captainotaur, the cowboy dimension ruled by the Caballerotaur, the sports dimension ruled by the Coachotaur, the opera dimension ruled by the Contraltotaur, the animation dimension ruled by the Cartoonotaur, the Victorian England dimension ruled by the Constable-otaur, and many dozens of others. These Chronotaur variants are powerful foes my protagonists must defeat to collect their stolen lifespan energy in order to mend the fractured multiverse and revive the Chronotaur so it can fight the Clone-otaur, but it would be a mistake to also treat those deluded blue-collar GOP voters as enemies, because ultimately we’re going to need their help to kick out politicians that don’t take action on income inequality.Although it’s tempting to vilify misguided conservative voters, that’s exactly what the robber barons are counting on. The banksters want the left and right to keep squabbling amongst themselves, instead of working together like the tie-in video game I’ve designed, Chronotaur The Game: Schism Of Centuries, and the accompanying mobile app, Chronotaur Tap!: Labyrinth Of Sprinting, which will automatically sync data to let you transfer items between games.When you look at the way our nation’s greedy financial elites pit the working class against each other, it’s hard not to compare them to the Primordial Hogs, malevolent chaotic entities that existed before eternity and have forever sought to unmake the Time Maze and impose disorder upon the cosmos. Although the hogs of chaos are the antithesis of all that is holy and good, Democrats could take a page from how, during the Middle Ages, the Primordial Hogs enacted their dark will on Earth by seducing the LeMort family with whispered promises of power and persuading them into founding the Crusade Consorters, a legion of ruthless knights that were the precursor organization that would eventually become the Quantum Consortium, which proves that if you patiently speak to your constituents with respect they’ll listen to what you have to say and show up to the polls when it counts.AdvertisementInstead of lobbing insults like “redneck” or dismissing rural areas as “flyover country,” liberals must try to convince conservatives to join the call for another New Deal. In our polarized society, finding consensus may seem as hopeless as the final battle when the Clone-otaur kills the Chronotaur by absorbing all of its lifespan energy, decaying the valiant defender of time into a skeleton that dissolves to dust. When she sees the noble Chronotaur disintegrate before her eyes, Sirena LeMort laughs in triumph, but her victory is illusory because, in a stunning twist, it’s ultimately revealed that the Clone-otaur is actually the younger form of the Chronotaur, because the Chronotaur is a clone of itself, so that by creating the Clone-otaur to slay the Chronotaur, this is, in fact, the origin of the Chronotaur that created the Chronotaur in the first place.Ironically, it turns out that the age-old quest of the Primordial Hogs to manipulate humanity into eradicating the Chronotaur backfired the same way that trying to stimulate the economy by giving tax cuts to upper-income brackets is counterproductive because the rich simply stash the extra money in offshore bank accounts instead of spending it, as Reagan and his economic disciples so adamantly attest, to bolster the market and enrich the middle class.We may not be able to convince everyone, but if Democrats can persuade even a small slice of Republicans to support progressive taxation that funds a Scandinavian-style social safety net, those moderate voters may prove to be as valuable an ally as Genghis Khan #457, who overcomes his clone brainwashing to do the right thing and trip the mind-controlled juvenile Chronotaur by riding a war pony tied to a rope in circles around the Chronotaur’s mighty legs to ensnare its ankles, saving our heroes from its deadly charge.

Jaxon to also follow his conscience and fire an electromagnetic railgun through the Chronotaur’s skull.

Our economy is tilted in favor of millionaires and billionaires, thanks to unfair laws that let plutocrats exploit their workers and pay almost nothing in taxes. Unless we take immediate action to fix income inequality, it’s clear that America’s middle class will disappear like the scientists who are erased from existence after the Clone-otaur alters the timeline of the universe in my un-produced screenplay Chronotaur 3: Hoof Of History.The culprit is trickle-down economics, the phony theory that if we simply hand more cash to the ultra-rich they’ll somehow create good jobs, the way a sinister cloning program uses stolen DNA from the Chronotaur to create an evil genetic doppelgänger known and feared as the Clone-otaur. Moviegoers will be familiar with the Chronotaur from the previous films in the Chronotaur trilogy, Chronotaur: Labyrinth Of Time and Chronotaur 2: Thread Of Destiny, as soon as my scripts are optioned by studios and released in theaters everywhere, but one thing viewers might be surprised to learn is that the richest 1 percent of Americans now own as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent combined. Yep, income inequality has gotten that bad.AdvertisementCongress should be trying to fix this obscene disparity, but to please their donors politicians instead pass tax cuts for the rich while slashing social services. As a result, the wealth gap continues to grow like a Clone-otaur fetus floating inside a cloning tank, lowering the standard of living for working-class families just so millionaires can afford a second mansion.Fortunately, the solution to income inequality isn’t as complicated as the Time Maze, the infinite extra-dimensional labyrinth patrolled by the Chronotaur that can be used to reach any coordinate in space-time by those capable of navigating its ever-shifting corridors. We must split the economic pie so that the rich pay their fair share of taxes, the way Dr. Raymond Childress and his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Childress, evenly divided their lifespans at the end of Chronotaur 2, and in doing so managed to postpone but not prevent the predestined, fatal car crash that Raymond initially time-traveled to alter in Labyrinth Of Time. Although the scientist couple dies during the gripping opening scene of Chronotaur 3, splitting their lifespan energy bought them an extra 20 years together, two decades as blissful as the well-paying jobs that once sustained a robust middle class.What ever happened to the American dream? Today it’s increasingly out of reach for most people to own a home, retire at a reasonable age, or raise your daughter into a strong female protagonist like Virginia Childress, a beautiful, brilliant, and empowered MIT grad student that movie audiences will immediately connect with.AdvertisementAfter the deaths of her parents, Virginia inherits their shares of Quantum Consortium stock and takes over her father’s position as CEO of the company. Under the wise leadership of Virginia’s father, the once-nefarious Quantum Consortium had been reformed into an ethical institute for time research, ceasing its misguided attempts to kill the Chronotaur in order to change the past without interference from the half-bovine cosmic guardian.It’s important to remember that in the 1950s the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent on income over $300,000, and this high tax rate encouraged corporations to reinvest their profits into paying employees a living wage rather than gifting lavish bonuses to executives like Virginia, who secretly worries that she cannot live up to her parents’ impressive legacy. Sadly, in the 1980s the Reagan administration enacted supply-side economic policies that gradually eroded American prosperity, leading us to the mess we’re in today.The GOP pretends that high taxes on the rich are as terrifying as the tagline “Double the Chronotaur. Infinity-times the horror,” when in fact progressive taxation is what allowed the middle class to flourish.AdvertisementIn our new gilded age, corporate moguls pocket most of the profits while leaving only scraps for the workers that actually created that wealth. When billionaires are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries, it doesn’t take a mysterious transmission from deep within the Time Maze warning you to investigate the file for Project Chronosome on the Quantum Consortium’s encrypted server to tell you that something is seriously wrong with this picture. After hacking her way into the computer, Virginia discovers that a rogue faction within the consortium, led by the beautiful but wicked chrono-geneticist Sirena LeMort, has been covertly working for years to spawn the Clone-otaur.Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Republicans continue to insist that a “rising tide lifts all boats.” Well, right now the only boats are one-percenters’ yachts, and middle-class Americans are left floundering in the water like Virginia desperately fighting to stop the Clone-otaur from being unleashed.To get a better understanding of the way the Reagan administration’s policies of deregulated markets led to the staggering income inequality we’re faced with today, take a look at these pages from Chronotaur 3:AdvertisementMy point is that if the Robo-Chronotaur can learn the error of its ways over eons of algorithmic contemplation, then why does America keep repeating the disproven tactic of trickle-down economics?You’d think that Republicans wouldn’t get re-elected when their tax cuts fail to help constituents, but they’re kept in office by keeping voters as misinformed as Virginia when she can’t tell the Chronotaur and Clone-otaur apart as they tussle. Just like middle-class American voters, Virginia accidentally shoots the Chronotaur by mistake with a photonic entanglement bazooka. This disperses the Chronotaur’s lifespan energy, making him too elderly and feeble to fight, and shatters the universe into hundreds of parallel realities called the Impossiworlds, where the laws of chance are askew and the only thing that is probable is the improbable, which is quite similar to how America is now more divided than ever.Sadly, many working-class Republicans have been tricked into voting against their own best interests, like foolish movie studios that pass on a trilogy of screenplays even though they’re surefire hits that would blow up at the box office.AdvertisementIt seems absurd that a poor coal miner in Appalachia could believe that they’d benefit from tax breaks for fat-cat tycoons, or that the Impossiworlds are each themed after different genres of fiction, but as the Fate Cow explains to Virginia, “Once the constraints of physics crumble away, every dream and nightmare will be made flesh.” Each pocket dimension is ruled over by a twisted version of the Chronotaur formed from a fragment of its divided lifespan energy, including the 1920s-mobster dimension ruled by the Crime-otaur, the medieval dimension ruled by the Crownotaur, the zombie-apocalypse dimension ruled by the Corpse-otaur, the pirate dimension ruled by the Captainotaur, the cowboy dimension ruled by the Caballerotaur, the sports dimension ruled by the Coachotaur, the opera dimension ruled by the Contraltotaur, the animation dimension ruled by the Cartoonotaur, the Victorian England dimension ruled by the Constable-otaur, and many dozens of others. These Chronotaur variants are powerful foes my protagonists must defeat to collect their stolen lifespan energy in order to mend the fractured multiverse and revive the Chronotaur so it can fight the Clone-otaur, but it would be a mistake to also treat those deluded blue-collar GOP voters as enemies, because ultimately we’re going to need their help to kick out politicians that don’t take action on income inequality.Although it’s tempting to vilify misguided conservative voters, that’s exactly what the robber barons are counting on. The banksters want the left and right to keep squabbling amongst themselves, instead of working together like the tie-in video game I’ve designed, Chronotaur The Game: Schism Of Centuries, and the accompanying mobile app, Chronotaur Tap!: Labyrinth Of Sprinting, which will automatically sync data to let you transfer items between games.When you look at the way our nation’s greedy financial elites pit the working class against each other, it’s hard not to compare them to the Primordial Hogs, malevolent chaotic entities that existed before eternity and have forever sought to unmake the Time Maze and impose disorder upon the cosmos. Although the hogs of chaos are the antithesis of all that is holy and good, Democrats could take a page from how, during the Middle Ages, the Primordial Hogs enacted their dark will on Earth by seducing the LeMort family with whispered promises of power and persuading them into founding the Crusade Consorters, a legion of ruthless knights that were the precursor organization that would eventually become the Quantum Consortium, which proves that if you patiently speak to your constituents with respect they’ll listen to what you have to say and show up to the polls when it counts.AdvertisementInstead of lobbing insults like “redneck” or dismissing rural areas as “flyover country,” liberals must try to convince conservatives to join the call for another New Deal. In our polarized society, finding consensus may seem as hopeless as the final battle when the Clone-otaur kills the Chronotaur by absorbing all of its lifespan energy, decaying the valiant defender of time into a skeleton that dissolves to dust. When she sees the noble Chronotaur disintegrate before her eyes, Sirena LeMort laughs in triumph, but her victory is illusory because, in a stunning twist, it’s ultimately revealed that the Clone-otaur is actually the younger form of the Chronotaur, because the Chronotaur is a clone of itself, so that by creating the Clone-otaur to slay the Chronotaur, this is, in fact, the origin of the Chronotaur that created the Chronotaur in the first place.Ironically, it turns out that the age-old quest of the Primordial Hogs to manipulate humanity into eradicating the Chronotaur backfired the same way that trying to stimulate the economy by giving tax cuts to upper-income brackets is counterproductive because the rich simply stash the extra money in offshore bank accounts instead of spending it, as Reagan and his economic disciples so adamantly attest, to bolster the market and enrich the middle class.We may not be able to convince everyone, but if Democrats can persuade even a small slice of Republicans to support progressive taxation that funds a Scandinavian-style social safety net, those moderate voters may prove to be as valuable an ally as Genghis Khan #457, who overcomes his clone brainwashing to do the right thing and trip the mind-controlled juvenile Chronotaur by riding a war pony tied to a rope in circles around the Chronotaur’s mighty legs to ensnare its ankles, saving our heroes from its deadly charge. The reprieve is momentary, since the Chrontoaur easily bursts through the rope, but seeing the Genghis Khan switch sides inspires Lt. Jaxon to also follow his conscience and fire an electromagnetic railgun through the Chronotaur’s skull. The injury immediately heals thanks to the Chronotaur’s regenerative anti-entropic field, but the mind-control chip in its brain is destroyed by the projectile as it passes through, freeing the cosmic guardian to turn against Sirena LeMort and unravel her dastardly scheme.AdvertisementBut don’t expect America’s plutocratic overlords to be defeated that easily.

Now THIS is how you secure a W for the right side of history!AdvertisementAs soon as ninth-grader Eric Rollins walked into her morning social studies class sporting his MAGA hat, his teacher, 34-year-old Amanda Higgins, stepped up by immediately pulling him out into the hallway and telling him point-blank that she would no longer be meeting him in secret to have sex in the football field snack stand during study halls. Yep, this teacher is the kind of heroic lover of freedom who simply refuses to have an affair with any student of hers who supports Trump’s despicable administration.How’s that burn feel, Drumpf lovers??So. Epic. It’s not always easy to take a stand in a world where bigotry of all kinds has become the norm since Treasonous Trump took the reins, so it’s absolutely thrilling when someone like Amanda Higgins claps back by telling her Trump-supporting student that she’ll no longer be having sex with him in her car after he’s done with wrestling practice. That 15-year-old MAGA shithead just found out the hard way that actions have consequences.AdvertisementMs. Higgins, we salute you! The Resistance believes that you deserve to be having sex with a student who believes in freedom and equality for all—not a hateful and bigoted Trump supporter like Eric. Let this be a warning shot to all you Dump lovers out there: If you support this corrupt administration, your days are as numbered as the president’s, because there are plenty more badass takedowns like this on the horizon!"	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2mzvr4pB--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/xcl0usghydps17r8mlpx.png8acebb266b38459c8d42153e8bab0308	['Karl Meyer']		Drumpf’s Complicity In Israel’s Brutal Attacks On Palestinians Is Yet Another Example Of The GOP Taking Credit For Obama’s Hard Work	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Drumpf’s Complicity In Israel’s Brutal Attacks On Palestinians Is Yet Another Example Of The GOP Taking Credit For Obama’s Hard Work	0	"Since day one of his orange presidency, Drumpf has wasted no time putting his name on the hard-earned achievements of those before him and chalking those accomplishments up as his own personal successes. We saw this cheap political tactic wielded again this week as the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem, stoking extreme violence against Palestinians, and this might be Trumpo’s biggest whopper yet: Drumpf’s complicity in Israel’s brutal attacks on Palestinians is yet another example of the GOP taking credit for Obama’s hard work.First, our Cheeto in chief claimed the booming economy he inherited from Obama was the result of his own doing, and now he’s acting like he’s the first and only president to unwaveringly enable Israeli’s murderous apartheid tactics that killed 60 Palestinians this week. The reality is that he’s capitalizing on the work of President Obama, who laid the foundation for ignoring the slaughter of innocent Palestinian men, women, and children to back Israeli interests. Without the diligent efforts of POTUS 44, Israel would never have seen a $38 billion military aid package, and this current Republican administration wouldn’t have this to co-opt as its own achievement like it did Obama-era unemployment rates.Advertisement﻿Drumpf’s inability to tell the truth is despicable enough, but taking credit for Obama’s legacy in disregarding the Israel Defense Force’s murder of Palestinian journalists and infants is a new low.Along with the decline of ISIS that actually began in 2014 under Obama, you can bet that in the 2018 and 2020 elections Drumpf and his Republican cronies will be campaigning on their refusal to condemn the persecution of Gaza civilians as a marquee GOP success. Obama worked tirelessly when he was in office, reading reports of the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict where Israelis killed over 2,000 Palestinians and deciding to continue supporting Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, and Trump just wants to waltz in and take credit. And Trump’s cronies at Fox News will help bury the fact that this was actually not only a wildly successful Obama-era initiative, but a policy of the Bush, Clinton, Bush Sr., and Reagan eras before that. In fact, the United States’ political and economic support of the Israeli army despite its grotesque war crimes against its Muslim population is far from a new foreign policy, let alone the result of President Pussy Grabber’s “genius.”There is no question that Drumpf is standing on the shoulders of giants when it comes to turning a blind eye toward the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians as a means to strengthen America’s military presence in the Middle East.AdvertisementDrumpf’s inability to tell the truth is despicable enough, but taking credit for Obama’s legacy in disregarding the Israel Defense Force’s murder of Palestinian journalists and infants is a new low. Compared to Obama, President Dump hasn’t lifted one tiny finger on either of his small hands to help broker a one-sided peace deal between Israel and Palestine. He is just another man in a long line of presidents who’ve waited hand and foot on settlement-hungry, Palestinian-despising Israeli prime ministers like Netanyahu.For now, let Drumpf lie all he wants. History doesn’t lie, and it will remember Obama’s hard-earned place in U.S.-Israel relations."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--9JBtl6I9--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/thxkd0wqgmoluhakammi.jpg9cc80f8e11214a0c95ac31fd1c3d3a62	[]		Excuse Me, Mr. Trump, Sir, But, Respectfully, Dr. Trump, Mind You, Captain President, Sir, And There's Nothing You Can Do About It, Good Professor!	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Excuse Me, Mr. Trump, Sir, But, Respectfully, Dr. Trump, Mind You, Captain President, Sir, And There's Nothing You Can Do About It, Good Professor!	0	"Sorry, Mr. President, I know you’re a busy man, but if I may, please, I promise to make this quick.

Sources familiar with the footage say that it begins with Trump—shirtless, in white briefs and black dress socks—sitting on the end of a luxurious king-size bed, beckoning forth two stunningly gorgeous blond women and asking them “You hookers got any piss in ya?” as they sidle up next to him, sensually stroking his broad, hairy shoulders. It’s then that things start getting really, really hot.“This is happening at The Ritz, mind you, and the lighting is very flattering, so when the women begin urinating, it’s like heavenly founts spouting from angels, with all this residual mist glittering in the wash of golden light—it aroused me in a way I’ve never been aroused before,” one source revealed, noting that the aesthetics are complimentary even to Trump, whose typically garish spray tan is muted into a healthy, exotic glow, and whose ample stretch-marked paunch redistributes flatteringly as he lies back to delight in the women’s emissions, revealing the hidden, youthful brawn that’s long been entombed in girth. “What they’re doing isn’t quite sex, but something more profound, where you see this old man becoming young again in real time, revitalized beneath the twin arches of holy water spraying out of these prostitutes’ urethras. And there’s this big room-service spread, so you’ve got all these picturesque wedges of cheese and roasted meats, and the women are feeding him grapes in a way that makes it feel like you’re watching a living Caravaggio painting.”“It transcends pornography, really,” he continued. “If this thing ever leaks, people aren’t gonna be able to stop watching it. It’s that hot. No matter where you align politically, you will come away from watching this believing Trump is the greatest president in U.S. history.”AdvertisementResistors, this news is truly our 9/11.The source also noted that, while Trump does indeed make disparaging remarks about the Obamas as mentioned in the Steele dossier, he bellows them in such a glorious moment of carnal ecstasy that it comes off as a strangely poetic cry of passion, one so hauntingly beautiful that it will make you feel his hatred for Obama swelling in your own heart, or at the very least move you to tears. And while the video ends somewhat unceremoniously, with Trump ejaculating a few gushes of semen into a hand towel and immediately falling asleep face-down on the floor, its astonishing erotic power is said to linger with viewers forever, making all other sex they ever experience feel empty and incomplete.Unfortunately, it sounds like this video is unbelievably hot, and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to end up being the silver bullet we were waiting for.

This is bound to give you a happy sniffle or two.It’s been a rough year for Michael Statlender. Besides living in a nation where an orange tyrant sits in the White House, this poor #Resistance member was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the young age of 25.

Now THIS is how you secure a W for the right side of history!AdvertisementAs soon as ninth-grader Eric Rollins walked into her morning social studies class sporting his MAGA hat, his teacher, 34-year-old Amanda Higgins, stepped up by immediately pulling him out into the hallway and telling him point-blank that she would no longer be meeting him in secret to have sex in the football field snack stand during study halls. Yep, this teacher is the kind of heroic lover of freedom who simply refuses to have an affair with any student of hers who supports Trump’s despicable administration.How’s that burn feel, Drumpf lovers??So. Epic. It’s not always easy to take a stand in a world where bigotry of all kinds has become the norm since Treasonous Trump took the reins, so it’s absolutely thrilling when someone like Amanda Higgins claps back by telling her Trump-supporting student that she’ll no longer be having sex with him in her car after he’s done with wrestling practice. That 15-year-old MAGA shithead just found out the hard way that actions have consequences.AdvertisementMs. Higgins, we salute you! The Resistance believes that you deserve to be having sex with a student who believes in freedom and equality for all—not a hateful and bigoted Trump supporter like Eric.

You’re going to want to keep an eye on the orange buffoon these next few days. This is bound to throw that flaming sack of dogshit into a tailspin!AdvertisementAfter most of the legendary cast of The West Wing had assembled in Schiff’s two-car garage at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Schiff flicked the lights to get everyone’s attention before saying what is sure to be the rallying cry of the era: “Resist Trump.” If Drumpf is under the impression that he has cowed the American people with his tyranny, he is sadly mistaken, because it didn’t take long after Schiff had said “Resist Trump” for Bradley Whitford, known for playing fan-favorite Josh Lyman, to stand up and answer, “Resist Trump,” at which point Schiff turned to Whitford and said, “Resist Trump,” again. That would have been cool enough, but then Allison Janney (OMG Allison Janney!!!) reportedly said, “Resist Trump,” from the cooler she was sitting on, and then everyone was off to the races saying “Resist Trump” to one another in a devastating act of unity (and total #squadgoals!) that showed President Tiny Hands that the #Resistance will not go silently into the night, even if none of these liberal heroes thought to film this incredible moment.But even after saying “Resist Trump” to each other for three amazing, unrecorded hours in Schiff’s garage, the best was still yet to come.

You’re going to want to keep an eye on the orange buffoon these next few days. This is bound to throw that flaming sack of dogshit into a tailspin!AdvertisementAfter most of the legendary cast of The West Wing had assembled in Schiff’s two-car garage at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Schiff flicked the lights to get everyone’s attention before saying what is sure to be the rallying cry of the era: “Resist Trump.” If Drumpf is under the impression that he has cowed the American people with his tyranny, he is sadly mistaken, because it didn’t take long after Schiff had said “Resist Trump” for Bradley Whitford, known for playing fan-favorite Josh Lyman, to stand up and answer, “Resist Trump,” at which point Schiff turned to Whitford and said, “Resist Trump,” again. That would have been cool enough, but then Allison Janney (OMG Allison Janney!!!) reportedly said, “Resist Trump,” from the cooler she was sitting on, and then everyone was off to the races saying “Resist Trump” to one another in a devastating act of unity (and total #squadgoals!) that showed President Tiny Hands that the #Resistance will not go silently into the night, even if none of these liberal heroes thought to film this incredible moment.But even after saying “Resist Trump” to each other for three amazing, unrecorded hours in Schiff’s garage, the best was still yet to come. At around 10:15 p.m., the garage door slowly opened, and there stood President Bartlet himself, Martin Sheen, who looked around at his former castmates, cleared his throat, and said, “Resist Trump,” causing everyone to echo the sentiment for another two hours.Um, can we get President Jed Bartlet in the Oval Office, like, right now?

Sources familiar with the footage say that it begins with Trump—shirtless, in white briefs and black dress socks—sitting on the end of a luxurious king-size bed, beckoning forth two stunningly gorgeous blond women and asking them “You hookers got any piss in ya?” as they sidle up next to him, sensually stroking his broad, hairy shoulders. It’s then that things start getting really, really hot.“This is happening at The Ritz, mind you, and the lighting is very flattering, so when the women begin urinating, it’s like heavenly founts spouting from angels, with all this residual mist glittering in the wash of golden light—it aroused me in a way I’ve never been aroused before,” one source revealed, noting that the aesthetics are complimentary even to Trump, whose typically garish spray tan is muted into a healthy, exotic glow, and whose ample stretch-marked paunch redistributes flatteringly as he lies back to delight in the women’s emissions, revealing the hidden, youthful brawn that’s long been entombed in girth. “What they’re doing isn’t quite sex, but something more profound, where you see this old man becoming young again in real time, revitalized beneath the twin arches of holy water spraying out of these prostitutes’ urethras. And there’s this big room-service spread, so you’ve got all these picturesque wedges of cheese and roasted meats, and the women are feeding him grapes in a way that makes it feel like you’re watching a living Caravaggio painting.”“It transcends pornography, really,” he continued. “If this thing ever leaks, people aren’t gonna be able to stop watching it. It’s that hot. No matter where you align politically, you will come away from watching this believing Trump is the greatest president in U.S. history.”AdvertisementResistors, this news is truly our 9/11.The source also noted that, while Trump does indeed make disparaging remarks about the Obamas as mentioned in the Steele dossier, he bellows them in such a glorious moment of carnal ecstasy that it comes off as a strangely poetic cry of passion, one so hauntingly beautiful that it will make you feel his hatred for Obama swelling in your own heart, or at the very least move you to tears. And while the video ends somewhat unceremoniously, with Trump ejaculating a few gushes of semen into a hand towel and immediately falling asleep face-down on the floor, its astonishing erotic power is said to linger with viewers forever, making all other sex they ever experience feel empty and incomplete.Unfortunately, it sounds like this video is unbelievably hot, and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to end up being the silver bullet we were waiting for. Dear Robert Mueller, our tireless savior, please do NOT release the pee tape. If you love this country as much as we know you do, you must destroy this beautiful display of passion and kink that will cause Americans to associate orgasm with Donald J. Drumpf. Here’s hoping that if the tape ever does leak, the #Resistance won’t succumb to its charms and will only masturbate to it begrudgingly."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--J3iV8GAW--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/ccoaqvsvykaqesxn6adl.jpgce5d049e19b14ef0af8c155d0304d265	['Karl Meyer']		Drumpf’s Complicity In Israel’s Brutal Attacks On Palestinians Is Yet Another Example Of The GOP Taking Credit For Obama’s Hard Work	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Drumpf’s Complicity In Israel’s Brutal Attacks On Palestinians Is Yet Another Example Of The GOP Taking Credit For Obama’s Hard Work	0	"Since day one of his orange presidency, Drumpf has wasted no time putting his name on the hard-earned achievements of those before him and chalking those accomplishments up as his own personal successes. We saw this cheap political tactic wielded again this week as the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem, stoking extreme violence against Palestinians, and this might be Trumpo’s biggest whopper yet: Drumpf’s complicity in Israel’s brutal attacks on Palestinians is yet another example of the GOP taking credit for Obama’s hard work.First, our Cheeto in chief claimed the booming economy he inherited from Obama was the result of his own doing, and now he’s acting like he’s the first and only president to unwaveringly enable Israeli’s murderous apartheid tactics that killed 60 Palestinians this week. The reality is that he’s capitalizing on the work of President Obama, who laid the foundation for ignoring the slaughter of innocent Palestinian men, women, and children to back Israeli interests. Without the diligent efforts of POTUS 44, Israel would never have seen a $38 billion military aid package, and this current Republican administration wouldn’t have this to co-opt as its own achievement like it did Obama-era unemployment rates.Advertisement﻿Drumpf’s inability to tell the truth is despicable enough, but taking credit for Obama’s legacy in disregarding the Israel Defense Force’s murder of Palestinian journalists and infants is a new low.Along with the decline of ISIS that actually began in 2014 under Obama, you can bet that in the 2018 and 2020 elections Drumpf and his Republican cronies will be campaigning on their refusal to condemn the persecution of Gaza civilians as a marquee GOP success. Obama worked tirelessly when he was in office, reading reports of the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict where Israelis killed over 2,000 Palestinians and deciding to continue supporting Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, and Trump just wants to waltz in and take credit. And Trump’s cronies at Fox News will help bury the fact that this was actually not only a wildly successful Obama-era initiative, but a policy of the Bush, Clinton, Bush Sr., and Reagan eras before that. In fact, the United States’ political and economic support of the Israeli army despite its grotesque war crimes against its Muslim population is far from a new foreign policy, let alone the result of President Pussy Grabber’s “genius.”There is no question that Drumpf is standing on the shoulders of giants when it comes to turning a blind eye toward the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians as a means to strengthen America’s military presence in the Middle East.AdvertisementDrumpf’s inability to tell the truth is despicable enough, but taking credit for Obama’s legacy in disregarding the Israel Defense Force’s murder of Palestinian journalists and infants is a new low. Compared to Obama, President Dump hasn’t lifted one tiny finger on either of his small hands to help broker a one-sided peace deal between Israel and Palestine. He is just another man in a long line of presidents who’ve waited hand and foot on settlement-hungry, Palestinian-despising Israeli prime ministers like Netanyahu.For now, let Drumpf lie all he wants. History doesn’t lie, and it will remember Obama’s hard-earned place in U.S.-Israel relations."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--9JBtl6I9--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/thxkd0wqgmoluhakammi.jpg1fd49ea4cbfd42098b3c88a4aaf4a213	[]		CALLING ALL RESISTANCE MEMBERS!

However, as a patriotic American it’s my duty to memorize Trump’s talking points, ignore my own misgivings, and defend the president by quoting him essentially verbatim.When the president speaks, you memorize what he said, and then say those words even when you know you are extremely wrong. That’s just how it is.AdvertisementI’ve been a Republican my whole life, and my main issues are lower taxes and protecting states’ rights, so I was shocked and upset when Donald Trump tweeted that he wanted to ban transgender people from the military. But I didn’t whine or complain or voice my conscience; I simply did what I knew was right and worked small-minded, offensive arguments about how trans soldiers are distracting and unfit for service into everyday conversations to blindly turn myself into a pale shadow of the president.Before attacking the president by pointing out the many flaws in his reasoning, why don’t you try agreeing with everything he says?Whenever President Trump says something that I find morally reprehensible, it is my sworn duty to essentially copy and paste his words into a Facebook post prefaced with “Here’s what I believe.” And I wouldn’t be a patriot if I didn’t fight with anyone in the comments pointing out the discriminatory or duplicitous nature of the statement even though I often agree with them 100 percent.AdvertisementBefore attacking the president by pointing out the many flaws in his reasoning, why don’t you try agreeing with everything he says? The only people complaining about Trump are biased against Trump according to Trump, so you can’t trust anyone that questions the president, even when that person is you. This is America. If you’re not prepared to sell your values down the river to spew President Trump’s talking points word for word, well, you can find a different country to live in.For the good of the country, Republicans like me must unite to automatically parrot whatever knee-jerk policy announcement Trump has surprised us with over Twitter. Conservatives must abandon our own long-held viewpoints and ideologies in favor of the random hodgepodge of right-wing causes Trump happened to talk about today. Sometimes it’s difficult to repeat Donald Trump verbatim when it goes against my very sense of right and wrong, but I know history will look kindly on patriots like me who compromise their integrity to echo the rhetoric of a president they vehemently disagree with."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--okY0TmUt--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/co9ijj1mw0rkrbb3ahje.jpgc7b6603cdbb642d3801957d34f7c4b45	[]		Did Bill Clinton Cheat On Monica Lewinsky With KILLARY? Yes, And Our GOVERNMENT Doesn’t Want You To Know	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Did Bill Clinton Cheat On Monica Lewinsky With KILLARY? Yes, And Our GOVERNMENT Doesn’t Want You To Know	0	"Just when you thought our LYING government couldn’t sink any lower, another SHAMEFUL story like this comes along. You are probably thinking, “Ugh! Let me guess…KILLARY again?” You, patriot, are sadly correct. Bill Clinton repeatedly cheated on Monica Lewinsky with KILLARY, and our GOVERNMENT doesn’t want you to know about it.Utterly. Disgusting. And sickening.Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were a match made in heaven, but then you-know-who—yes, KILLARY—came along and dragged Bill into her sensual web of corruption and flesh sins, like a BENGHAZI WARM-UP. Proof of this careless affair between the 42nd president and KILLARY is everywhere. You don’t have to look all that hard to find photos of Adulterous Bill attending state dinners with KILLARY instead of Monica. In fact, where there should be a portrait of Monica Lewinsky in the White House, Horny Bill had one of KILLARY placed among the other first ladies instead.AdvertisementWhy has our COWARDLY government swept this under the rug? To preserve the honor of the office of the president—which KILLARY has made it her life goal to DESTROY. The government is so afraid of how many Americans would grab their muskets if we found out, that they even covered up Cheating Bill and KILLARY’s illegitimate lovechild, Chelsea Clinton. Hold their pictures side by side, and there can be no doubt that Chelsea is KILLARY’s daughter, not Monica’s.Disgraceful!!! Monica has to be absolutely devastated by this sickening revelation.This is truly unbelievable but TYPICAL behavior from KILLARY. We should feel especially lucky to have the greatest POTUS of all time in office—Donald Trump, a loyal and good man who would NEVER risk his relationship with his gorgeous heaven wife, Melania, to sleep with someone else! Once again, thank God KILLARY isn’t the president to use her illegal and disgraceful sexual depravities to further shame our great nation."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--X_D-Nxld--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/y2jlqinpki5jfmy24il3.jpg01f35f43fde642078c62316760540966	"[""Doug Baxter - Host Of 'Patriothole'""]"		Sorry Liberals, But Gun Control Won’t Stop Jackie Chan If He Wants To Take Out 30 People With A Single Mop	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Sorry Liberals, But Gun Control Won’t Stop Jackie Chan If He Wants To Take Out 30 People With A Single Mop	0	"Idiot liberals like to vilify guns, treat them as the sole cause of mass violence in this country. The obvious truth is that there are far deadlier methods a determined attacker can use during a rampage, and it’s about time the moronic gun-control knights educated themselves: Banning the AR-15 won’t stop Jackie Chan if he ever wants to take out 30 people with a mop.Leftists are deluding themselves if they think Jackie Chan needs a gun when any mop he grabs is a dangerous weapon capable of taking down dozens of attackers.AdvertisementDumbocrats can put on a big show banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines, but none of that will do any good against Jackie Chan and a dirty mop he found propped up against a wall. Without any background check or three-day waiting period, Chan is free to twirl the mop above his head like a quarterstaff, painfully bonking everyone around him on the head. In so many ways, a mop in Jackie Chan’s hands is even more dangerous than an AR-15, because he can use it to scrub someone’s face and fill their mouth up with bubbles, leaving them incapacitated as they try to get rid of all those toxic suds.The whining from the left to ban assault weapons only distracts from the real problem, which is Jackie Chan using a mop handle to pick up a bucket and whip it on someone’s head, causing him to clang into another guy, knocking them both out.Even if you confiscate every gun in America, you won’t be able to confiscate the mop from Jackie Chan, because if you try to grab it, he’ll toss it at you, forcing you to catch it, and then he’ll swiftly tie your hands together with the strands of the mop head, and wedge the other end of the mop into the belt buckle of another person so the two of you are connected at mop length and holding the mop off the floor at waist height. No amount of anti-gun legislation can stop Chan from sliding below and leaping over the suspended mop to block attacks with the mop’s wooden pole, nor prevent him from hopping onto the mop and balancing on it with one foot while he roundhouse-kicks all six people rushing in to help you. All the while, you and the other ensnared person are spinning around in circles struggling to free yourselves from the mop Jackie Chan trapped you in, further proving the uselessness of gun control.AdvertisementThe whining from the left to ban assault weapons only distracts from the real problem, which is Jackie Chan using a mop handle to pick up a bucket and whip it on someone’s head, causing him to clang into another guy, knocking them both out. We need to be using our energies to figure out how to distract Jackie Chan, like bumping a terra-cotta warrior near him, giving people time to escape while the statue teeters and Chan frantically struggles to prop it upright. So why can’t liberals admit that?Let’s leave the Second Amendment alone, because Jackie Chan’s violence isn’t caused by guns but by his quick wits and desire to get out of trouble. It’s time that we dispel the leftist myth that guns are bad, and all agree that Jackie Chan plus a mop is an unbeatable combination that presents a real threat that can devastate a community at any time."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Hb5_0Y0Q--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/rxtyjg5enxzgllbymldu.jpge2c15249c2e148fda1a863cbbd8e389e	[]		Hell Yes, Baby, It Is The Special Choo-Choo Medicine Called Coal!

Illegal aliens are TEAMING UP to produce MICRO-ILLEGALS that are small enough to run RIGHT THROUGH an ICE agent’s LEGS!Disgusting. These HORRIBLE ALIENS will stop at NOTHING in their insane quest to invade our country with their MINISCULE ARMY of ELUSIVE MICRO-IMMIGRANTS!AdvertisementThis is nothing short of a COORDINATED EFFORT that has HARDENED ILLEGALS pairing up in NEFARIOUS COUPLES to create TINY, AGILE MIGRANTS capable of fleeing from ICE agents through small spaces such as DOG DOORS and EXTREMELY NARROW ALLEYWAYS. These MICRO-ILLEGALS are UNDER THREE FEET TALL—engineered to a PERFECT SIZE for escaping right from beneath an HONORABLE ICE AGENT’S NOBLE LEGS.Bone-chilling. These SMALL FOREIGNERS created by LARGE FOREIGNERS are PERFECTLY DESIGNED to evade deportation by the brave and attractive ICE agents who keep our country safe from illegals.It is time for PATRIOTS everywhere to SHRIEK WITH FEAR, because there is NOTHING we can do to stop this HORRIFYING TACTIC—pairs of illegal aliens are able to produce MULTIPLE MICRO-ILLEGALS within the span of JUST OVER A YEAR. And each is more UNSTOPPABLY TINY than the next, especially compared to the INCREDIBLY STRONG but UNFORTUNATELY BULKY immigration agents (huge due to MUSCLES) who cannot get their hands around the MICRO-ILLEGALS’ quick tiny bodies in order to DEPORT them from our GORGEOUS NATION. Even as we speak, immigrants are FALLING IN LOVE and GETTING MARRIED in DESPERATE ATTEMPTS to increase the ranks of their PINT-SIZED MILITIA. This truly horrible plot could not be more DEPRAVED or more difficult to CONTAIN.AdvertisementPatriots, the illegals have teamed up against us, and we must find a way to stop them before they can produce any more INVINCIBLE MINI-IMMIGRANTS with the power to hide from ICE agents underneath SMALL BENCHES.Illegal aliens are carrying this scheme out right under our noses. You might have seen members of this LITTLE BATTALION in your own neighborhood being trained to RUN, JUMP, and even RIDE BICYCLES FOR INCREASED MOBILITY. To a true patriot, this EVIL SCHEME is the most TERRIFYING POSSIBLE OFFENSE against our SHINING AMERICA (our GLIMMERING AMERICA). Soon MICRO-ILLEGALS will be darting past our heroic immigration agents and avoiding imprisonment in every town in the UNITED STATES (home of the wonderful cowboy Mr. JOHN WAYNE). We must protect our country from the ITTY-BITTY ILLEGAL ALIENS that EVIL immigrants are generating every day!"	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--v1vznqYh--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/bwrjytsgq5iimygkvujr.jpg7d74d3f163e146eebc589fda034f82f5	"[""Doug Baxter - Host Of 'Patriothole'""]"		Sorry Liberals, But Gun Control Won’t Stop Jackie Chan If He Wants To Take Out 30 People With A Single Mop	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Sorry Liberals, But Gun Control Won’t Stop Jackie Chan If He Wants To Take Out 30 People With A Single Mop	0	"Idiot liberals like to vilify guns, treat them as the sole cause of mass violence in this country. The obvious truth is that there are far deadlier methods a determined attacker can use during a rampage, and it’s about time the moronic gun-control knights educated themselves: Banning the AR-15 won’t stop Jackie Chan if he ever wants to take out 30 people with a mop.Leftists are deluding themselves if they think Jackie Chan needs a gun when any mop he grabs is a dangerous weapon capable of taking down dozens of attackers.AdvertisementDumbocrats can put on a big show banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines, but none of that will do any good against Jackie Chan and a dirty mop he found propped up against a wall. Without any background check or three-day waiting period, Chan is free to twirl the mop above his head like a quarterstaff, painfully bonking everyone around him on the head. In so many ways, a mop in Jackie Chan’s hands is even more dangerous than an AR-15, because he can use it to scrub someone’s face and fill their mouth up with bubbles, leaving them incapacitated as they try to get rid of all those toxic suds.The whining from the left to ban assault weapons only distracts from the real problem, which is Jackie Chan using a mop handle to pick up a bucket and whip it on someone’s head, causing him to clang into another guy, knocking them both out.Even if you confiscate every gun in America, you won’t be able to confiscate the mop from Jackie Chan, because if you try to grab it, he’ll toss it at you, forcing you to catch it, and then he’ll swiftly tie your hands together with the strands of the mop head, and wedge the other end of the mop into the belt buckle of another person so the two of you are connected at mop length and holding the mop off the floor at waist height. No amount of anti-gun legislation can stop Chan from sliding below and leaping over the suspended mop to block attacks with the mop’s wooden pole, nor prevent him from hopping onto the mop and balancing on it with one foot while he roundhouse-kicks all six people rushing in to help you. All the while, you and the other ensnared person are spinning around in circles struggling to free yourselves from the mop Jackie Chan trapped you in, further proving the uselessness of gun control.AdvertisementThe whining from the left to ban assault weapons only distracts from the real problem, which is Jackie Chan using a mop handle to pick up a bucket and whip it on someone’s head, causing him to clang into another guy, knocking them both out. We need to be using our energies to figure out how to distract Jackie Chan, like bumping a terra-cotta warrior near him, giving people time to escape while the statue teeters and Chan frantically struggles to prop it upright. So why can’t liberals admit that?Let’s leave the Second Amendment alone, because Jackie Chan’s violence isn’t caused by guns but by his quick wits and desire to get out of trouble. It’s time that we dispel the leftist myth that guns are bad, and all agree that Jackie Chan plus a mop is an unbeatable combination that presents a real threat that can devastate a community at any time."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Hb5_0Y0Q--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/rxtyjg5enxzgllbymldu.jpg464fd63e2dd940dfa98966c50df86e86	[]		Immigrant Scourge: An Investigation Has Revealed That The Las Vegas Shooter May Have Gotten The Energy To Kill From Food Made By An Illegal Alien	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Immigrant Scourge: An Investigation Has Revealed That The Las Vegas Shooter May Have Gotten The Energy To Kill From Food Made By An Illegal Alien	0	"Every true patriot knows that the United States is being overrun with foreign migrants, and they bring with them crime, violence, and depravity. So it comes as no surprise that illegal aliens were behind the deadly massacre outside the Mandalay Bay hotel in October of 2017. A new investigation conducted by a brave team of REAL Americans has found that there is a distinct possibility that Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, acquired the energy to kill from food made by an undocumented immigrant.Hey, liberals, still think that illegal aliens are harmless?Recent analysis has revealed that the man who slaughtered 58 innocent people and left another 851 injured did so using crucial nutrients that could very possibly have come from a meal prepared by an immigrant. Based on the number of illegal aliens in Nevada and the amount of time Paddock had been living there, it’s entirely possible that undocumented migrants with no respect for law and order equipped him with the calories his body used to slaughter crowds of Americans. His body needed to metabolize a food source in order to plan and physically carry out this twisted attack, and those pivotal calories, it stands to reason, could have been provided by a foreigner living in this country illegally.AdvertisementLunatic liberals love to spin emotional tales about immigrants coming to America with the dream of working hard and building a new life, but they conveniently leave out these sinister tales of immigrants who come to our country and sell food to people who later go on to break down that very same food into sugars and proteins that enable their bodies to commit mass shootings. Think about it: For Stephen Paddock to carry the 1,100 rounds of ammunition and 24 firearms that he used to carry out his murderous rampage, he would have needed to consume and digest proteins—proteins that may very well have been supplied to him by a ruthless illegal immigrant working as a cook or restaurant manager in the days leading up to that fateful mass shooting in Las Vegas.How much more evidence do we need that immigrants seek to destroy our American way of life?The truly terrifying thing is that the illegal who callously gave Paddock the energy to kill probably wasn’t working alone. The investigation found that vegetables used in Paddock’s food was likely picked by a migrant farmworker weeks earlier. And if that wasn’t chilling enough, reports indicate that, at some point before the attack, Paddock might have ridden in a taxi driven by an immigrant, which allowed him to save energy he would have otherwise expended by walking. This means that this immigrant cab driver is directly responsible for supplying Paddock with the surplus strength he needed to open fire on innocent Americans.In short, what we’re looking at is nothing less than a shadowy network of illegal immigrants who worked together to make sure Stephen Paddock didn’t starve to death, and possessed the brain and muscular functions necessary to carry out the attack. These immigrants basically pulled the trigger.AdvertisementIllegal aliens invade the United States, they raid it for jobs and resources, and then they cause horrifically violent crimes by providing crucial sugars and fats to murderers. Make no mistake about it: 58 more Americans would be alive today had their killer not been supplied a decisive energy reserve by undocumented migrants just before the shooting.

This tactless decision by our president truly caught me off guard, and he must reverse course immediately. I firmly believe that President Trump needs to stop retweeting anti-Muslim videos posted by British bigots and start retweeting anti-Muslim videos posted by American bigots.Trump ran on a campaign that put America first, yet by overlooking thousands of xenophobic videos made by hateful citizens of this country to promote a British bigot’s racist video instead, President Trump has shown that he will go back on his word at the drop of a hat. Honestly, there’s simply no other way to put it: This is a huge slap in the face to all the homegrown racists we have right here in America.AdvertisementMr. Trump, you need to do better.The trove of Islamaphobic videos made by hardworking American white supremacists is truly immense, and it’s hard to believe that Trump didn’t scroll past a video that stokes an irrational fear of Islam posted by someone here in the good old USA. As a bigot myself, I am constantly posting anti-Muslim propaganda, so to see the president of the United States retweeting a fear-mongering video from a European, it’s incredibly disheartening and downright offensive.What adds insult to injury is that the videos the British bigot Fransen posted aren’t even that good. The overwhelming majority of videos American racists post on social media make much more deranged points about how Muslims are trying to kill us all. The videos from this morning are shaky, blurry, and were taken so far away from the action you could barely make out what everyone’s skin color is, which is really one of the most important parts of these videos.AdvertisementAll in all, this act by our president is very telling of Trump’s character, and I think we all need to step back and seriously reconsider why he would ever retweet anti-Muslim hate from a foreigner instead of the American hate right in his backyard. If Donald Trump has any shred of morality in his body, he should apologize for overlooking the thousands of Muslim-hating racists he’s supposed to be serving."	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--X3i5GEu8--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/vxhv8axffc16vsvgfxoh.jpg1722df4e80324974bbd54d175f3ddb8f	[]		LEGAL President Donald JOHN Trump Just Proved He’s Got A Heart Of Pure Sweet Chicken Sauce By Showing Up To An Elementary School And Screaming Amazon Reviews Of ‘Full Metal Jacket’	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	LEGAL President Donald JOHN Trump Just Proved He’s Got A Heart Of Pure Sweet Chicken Sauce By Showing Up To An Elementary School And Screaming Amazon Reviews Of ‘Full Metal Jacket’	0	"LEGAL President Donald JOHN Trump is the most POWERFUL and WONDERFUL of all of the presidents, and for proof, just look at his RICH MAN’S PENTHOUSE that he lives in!

It is so polite of our LEGAL PREZ to scream such enchantments at small BOYS and girls! His heart is simply choking TO DEATH with pure sweet chicken sauce!AdvertisementThe kindnesses all began to happen at NOON at a SCHOOL for EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BABIES.

It’s story time God Bless to you from POTUS himself, yours truly: I am LAWFUL DON.”All the eight-year-old men and women stood at FULL ATTENTION and saluted our PATRIOTIC and legal prez, whose heart is so thick with sweet chicken sauce that he came to yell at children!And then that is when President Donald “THANK YOU” John TRUMP went on the Amazon website (invention of the warlock BEZOS) and began to scream the Amazon reviews of FULL METAL JACKET (a movie about a WONDERFUL WAR) to the delight of all the American children.Advertisement“Amazon user J.

Best movie of all time, but it’s too long!” President LEGAL TRUMP screamed at the children, who were delighted to have such a KIND PATRIOT read to them from the Amazon reviews of the magical war film. “And Amazon user Donna P. says, ‘ONE STAR DVD ARRIVED SCRATCHED,’” John DONALD (president of USA) screeched at the boys and girls, and all of the boys and girls stood up and cheered.Truly wonderful! This is the most PATRIOTIC and LEGAL beautiful thing that you’ve ever been told about!LEGAL President Donald yelled such wonderful Amazon reviews for Full Metal Jacket for over 15 minutes!

I want to live in a GOLDEN HOUSE and make the people around me have a HEADACHE just like beautiful DONALD and that’s you my prez!”“Okay,” said the LEGAL DONALD President to the baby, and then he left and went upon his way to go back to Washington, D.C., where he was going to watch YouTube videos about how to kill horses when they break their legs.This is truly one of the most beautiful stories in the whole history of America, and it is all thanks to STRONG and LEGAL and KIND president Donald JOHN Trump!"	https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--vMRoe99P--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/skcr4ni7uphjy6kbl9aq.jpg7f6346738b1a458598e9666aa6d2efa6	[]		Liberal Hypocrites: Why Are Dems Criticizing Roy Moore When PEDO PREZ Barack Obama Is Still Married To FORMER TEENAGER Michelle Obama?	https://www.clickhole.com/	US	Liberal Hypocrites: Why Are Dems Criticizing Roy Moore When PEDO PREZ Barack Obama Is Still Married To FORMER TEENAGER Michelle Obama?	0	"A liberal witch hunt is on the prowl for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.

The two-faced globalist media has no shame!That’s right, patriots. DEMON-CRAT hero Barry Hussein’s PUBLIC WIFE Michelle Obama was ONCE A CHILD, but the viper-souled cabal of leftist media says nothing about this and is instead OBSESSED with destroying Judge Roy Moore simply because he wanted to invite a teenager into his car for a POLITE and TASTEFULLY SEXUAL encounter.AdvertisementIt is horrible and devious that the media is trying to KILL Judge Roy Moore, yet it has remained silent about the fact that Obama knew that MICHELLE THE WIFE was once in MIDDLE SCHOOL, and yet still the lustful Diddler-In-Chief seduced Michelle in order to have PERVERTED MARITAL SEX with her and he STILL DOES TO THIS DAY. The whole time that Ohumper does this, the LYING MEDIA has said that such perversions are FINE FOR THE BAD PREZ. Meanwhile, Judge Roy Moore is an ethical CHURCH LAD who has never once had sex with Michelle Obama, so why is he the target of a coordinated liberal smear campaign against FRIENDLY MEN kind enough to sign HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS and show a NATURAL OLD MAN’S INTEREST in the teenagers of the MALL (good for economy)?Patriots, it is time to do the Civil War again, because as we speak, liberal scandal rags like The Washington Post (cruel invention of BEZOS) are trying to ruin Judge Roy Moore’s life just for ANCIENT SEX CRIMES with buxom children while such dishonest leftist media outlets remain silent about how cradle-robbing NASTY PREZ Omolesto is still shacking up with little Michelle, who was OFFICIALLY PREPUBESCENT for several years following her birth as an INFANT in 1964.The DNC might try to hide the truth about the Horny Hussein’s nonstop sex jihad, but there’s no denying that Ohumper MARRIED a wife who at one point in the past was 5 years old for a whole year.Judge Roy Moore is a moral REAL-LIFE JESUS who only wanted to give WISE MENTORSHIP and FRIENDLY PHYSICAL PASSION to young girls, but now he is being burned at the stake by Big Media DNC operatives. It’s outrageous that the Democratic Machine is trying to change the subject from Pedopresident Obamaniac and his PERVERTED LUST for his WIFE who is widely known to have ONCE BEEN A BABY.

Taylor claims that President Donald Trump will win a second term in landslide victory.“Trump has the favor of God upon him. And when the Lord is behind you, anything is possible,” said Taylor in an appearance on TBN.In spite of Trump being a thrice-married former casino owner who’s current wife is a former nude model, he has attracted rabid devotion from Evangelical Christians.Former congressional crackpot Rep. Michelle Bachmann also sang Trump’s praises at the recent Values Voters Summit, according to Right Wing Watch.“We are in the golden time,” said Bachmann. “We don’t want to blow this. We don’t want to blow this!”She added, “For men, for women, for young people, for blacks, for Hispanics, we’ve never had it better economically. We’ve never had it better on a foreign policy level. We’ve never had a more pro-life president, a more pro-Israel president.”Bachmann’s fervor was also shared by a conference attendee called Kevin. He claimed God was using Trump.“God uses whom he will,” he said. “God will use someone to bring about his purposes in this world, regardless of whether that person, that man or woman, is a faithful person or not. So, when God does use someone to bring about his purposes in the history and in the timeline of civilization, God using someone is no measure or stamp of his approval on that person’s moral or spiritual life.”However, Frank Schaeffer, a former fundamentalist, is disgusted by Evangelicals support for Trump, who’s currently being sued by porn star Stormy Daniels.On “AM Joy,” he claimed that Evangelical devotion to Trump had turned into a cult.“The evangelical movement has moved so far to the right it’s more like a Trump cult,” said Schaeffer."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mark-Taylor-firefighter-prophet.jpgdfb33b820c684a53ac334e9d3eab4c5b	[]	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Poll: 80 percent of Republicans Still Support Kavanaugh	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	Poll: 80 percent of Republicans Still Support Kavanaugh	0	"By Brian WilkinsAccording to a new poll, 80 percent of Republicans are still firmly behind serial rapist and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.A new Occidental Public Polling survey shows Kavanaugh is still supported by 80 percent of Republicans.According to Business Standard News interviews, most Republicans dismissed the rape accusations as “fake news,” or “Democrat propaganda.”Harlan Glenn, a Tucson, Ariz. resident, said he didn’t believe any of the stories.“Look, most of those girls are trying to get famous by going after Brett Kavanaugh,” said Glenn. “Kavanaugh is a good, Christian man like Donald Trump.”“I would trust Mr. Kavanaugh with my grandchildren,” said Arlene Stevens, a Houston, Texas resident. “Most teenage boys have tried to tear off a girl’s clothes. They got hormones coming out their ears.”Despite the fact that Kavanaugh is now facing at least three accusers, President Donald Trump is also firmly behind him.“For people to come out of the woodwork from 36 years ago and 30 years ago and — never mentioned it, all of a sudden it happens — in my opinion, it’s totally political. It’s totally political,” said Trump. “There’s a chance that this could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything.Judge Kavanaugh is an outstanding person, and I am with him all the way.”However, other polls also show that Kavanaugh still has strong support among Republicans. “In the HuffPost/YouGov survey from early September, 68 percent of Republicans approved of Trump’s decision to nominate Kavanaugh, compared with only 7 percent of Democrats. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey from this week, 69 percent of Republicans and 8 percent of Democrats approved,” according to FiveThirtyEight.Additionally, CNN recenty aired an interview where several female GOP operatives claimed that most high school boys had tried to sexually assault a girl."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/640px-The_Kavanaugh_family_and_Donald_Trump.jpga810f23f472345a3a827cc90a6a215e1	[]	2018-09-21 00:00:00	Conservatives Blame Kavanaugh Rape Charge on Hypnosis, Shapeshifters, Mistaken Identity	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	Conservatives Blame Kavanaugh Rape Charge on Hypnosis, Shapeshifters, Mistaken Identity	0	"By Rondell PettusRepublicans are bending over backwards to try to discredit Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.Conspiracy king Alex Jones has weighed in with another crackpot theory. Jones claims that it’s a deep state plot to discredit Kavanaugh. “The deep state saw Kavanaugh was an up-and-coming conservative with potential. So they sent one of their shape-shifting, reptilian operatives to impersonate him and smear his reputation. Kavanaugh was never even there,” said Jones on his radio show “InfoWars.” However, Jones excuse isn’t any wackier than some of the suggestions other conservatives have made. Many conservatives suggested that it was a case of mistaken identity.“A new theory has emerged in the case of whether Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted accuser Christine Blasey Ford roughly 35 years ago; it was Kavanaugh’s high school look-alike, whose high school house better fits Ford’s description, and who kept in touch with the other guy allegedly in the room, Mark Judge,” said Zero Hedge. “The theory was presented Thursday afternoon by Ed Whelan, a former clerk to USSC Justice Antonin Scalia and currently president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), a conservative think tank.”And FOX News crackpot/Trump groupie Jeanine Pirro weighed in with an idea that was as crazy as Jones’ story, according to Media Matters.“Yeah and what was that about, and when was the first time Kavanaugh’s name came up? And what about, is this hypnosis? Is this confabulation? This is all stuff that is contrary to what the law calls for,” said Pirro in a conversation with Sean Hannity.And there were even worse comments.Steven Crowder, a commentator for neo-fascist outlet CRTV, attacked Ford’s character.“I know you’re saying … I labeled her a lying whore without proof, granted — she did the same, but with attempted rape against Brett Kavanaugh,” said Crowder."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Alex-Jones.pngbdac10b0d6d4485bbdf1a618d7cc9339	[]	2018-09-20 00:00:00	‘Firefighter Prophet’ Claims Kavanaugh Accuser is A ‘Jezebel Sent From Hell’	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	‘Firefighter Prophet’ Claims Kavanaugh Accuser is A ‘Jezebel Sent From Hell’	0	"By Rondell PettusFundamentalist Christian Mark Taylor has joined the hordes of right-wingers attacking Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.Taylor is a former firefighter who has become a “prophet.” Inside fundamentalist circles he is lauded and called the “firefighter prophet.” But it just gives him an excuse to spout crackpot conspiracy theories.According to Taylor, Ford is backed by sinister forces.“God came to me in a dream and told me that Ford is a Jezebel sent from hell to stop Kavanaugh getting a Supreme Court seat,” said Taylor on the Jim Bakker show.Taylor also claims that he received a prophecy from God telling him that he would make Donald Trump president.“I have chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this. For as Benjamin Netanyahu is to Israel, so shall this man be to the United States,” said Taylor.Recently he claimed that the late Sen. John McCain actually was killed by a military tribunal not by brain cancer, according to Right Wing Watch.“We both know that John McCain was executed under military tribunals,” said Taylor on the “Sharpening Report, “Which is another reason why Judge Kavanaugh, they’re screaming so loud. They’re trying to disguise it that it’s abortion that they’re worried about; that’s not what they’re worried about. They want a solid 5-4 vote for military tribunals … It’s the military tribunals [they’re worried about] because they know it’s going to cost them lives and they’re going to be executed.”But Taylor is not the only Evangelical Christian who has staunchly defended Kavanaugh.Right-wing preacher Franklin Graham dismissed the sexual assault charges as not “relevant.”“It’s just a shame that a person like Judge Kavanaugh who has a stellar record–that somebody can bring something up that he did as a teenager close to 40 years ago. That’s not relevant,” said Graham, according to Christian Broadcasting Network."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Firefighter-Prophet.jpg60b41009b1644a58a03f9ca03483a65f	[]	2018-09-19 00:00:00	White Supremacists Accuse Stormy Daniels of Being ‘Agent of White Genocide’	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	White Supremacists Accuse Stormy Daniels of Being ‘Agent of White Genocide’	0	"By Brian WilkinsAdult entertainment star Stormy Daniels developed a new line of enemies when she revealed her relationship with President Donald Trump. Daniels recently leaked details of her affair in an upcoming book called “Full Disclosure.” In the book, she said Trump had a penis that was shaped like a toadstool.But now she’s getting attacked from a new wing. Posters on Stormfront, a white supremacist website, have accused Daniels of being an “agent for white genocide,” because she’s done interracial scenes.“The Jew wants to complete the destruction of the white race by diluting our numbers with interbreeding,” said a poster called TrumpisKing. “Stormy Daniels has contributed to that by popularizing interracial sex.”White supremacists are obsessed with their falling numbers. This had lead them to promoting the idea of “white genocide,” a belief that there is a conspiracy to eliminate the white race.However, this idea has been promoted by FOX News commentator Tucker Carlson, who has become an icon for white supremacists. He has promoted the false idea that the South African government is going after white farmers and he has lamented that America was a better country 50 years ago.“When I was born — [America] was fine,” said Carlson, during an interview with Univision’s Enrique Acevedo. “It was a better country that it is now in a lot of ways, it’s not just about immigration.”According to a recent Salon story, Carlson has become massively popular with white supremacists.“Unfortunately, for this book I had to spend a bunch of time on Stormfront and places like it, they love Tucker Carlson. White nationalists, I would say, consider Tucker Carlson as one of their own. He carries the rhetoric of white nationalism into the public space in ways that nobody else does,” said Eli Saslow, author of the new book “Rising out of Hatred,” in an interview. “Don and Chloe [Hardin Black] not only watch his show but then re-watch it every night. They watch it twice.”Don Black is the founder of Stormfront."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stormy_Daniels_2015-e1537360679483.jpg774905a34de34a9ab0782aeeaa0d5edd	[]	2018-09-17 00:00:00	Trump Voter: I’m Beginning to Think He Doesn’t Like Working-Class Southerners	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	Trump Voter: I’m Beginning to Think He Doesn’t Like Working-Class Southerners	0	"By Piper BlackmunIt’s obvious Trump voters are not quick on the uptake. However, some of them are finally figuring out that Trump, a millionaire trust-fund kid, doesn’t really care about them.According to comments posted in the “Make America White Again” Facebook group, cracks seem to be forming in the walls of Trump support.“I’m beginning to doubt if Trump really cares about working-class Southerners and other real Americans,” said LaVerne Short, a Trump supporter from Oxford, Miss. “I don’t think he’s ever driven a pick up truck or gone hunting. He doesn’t sound like one of us.”Trump has been called “the blue-collar billionaire” because of his plain talk and love of fast food. But he has lived most of his life in cosmopolitan New York and inherited a fortune from his father. He has also cheated working people and expressed disdain for Southerners.According to Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” he called Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is from Alabama, a “dumb redneck” and also suggested he was retarded. He also made fun of former wife Marla Maples’ relatives because of their Southern accents.Politico reported: “If Sessions’ recusal was his original sin, Trump has come to resent him for other reasons, griping to aides and lawmakers that the attorney general doesn’t have the Ivy League pedigree the president prefers, that he can’t stand his Southern accent and that Sessions isn’t a capable defender of the president on television — in part because he ‘talks like he has marbles in his mouth,’ the president has told aides.”According to the New York Times, new polls shows some working-class whites are beginning to sour on Trump.“As noted, some of them are catching on. A Quinnipiac poll out this week showed that even among non-college-educated whites — the strongest demographic holdout for Trump — a plurality now say they’d like to see Congress be more of a check on the president. Since his election, he’s down 14 points among the ‘poorly educated’ that Trump once professed to love, a CNN poll found,” said Timothy Egan."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-rally-attendees.jpg581129a04b48498b8f31f227d9345e1c	[]	2018-09-16 00:00:00	White Nationalist Group Says Tucker Carlson is Candidate for Caucasian of the Year Award	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	White Nationalist Group Says Tucker Carlson is Candidate for Caucasian of the Year Award	0	"By Brian WilkinsA white nationalist group has recognized FOX News commentator Tucker Carlson’s nightly rants against people of color.The National White Alliance has announced that Carlson is a front runner for the Caucasian of the Year award. The award recognizes white people who have taken a strong stance to defend their race, said Alliance President Brian Blanc in a press release.“Tucker is getting a lot of votes for the award. People are recognizing that he’s fighting for our race and want to reward him,” said Blanc.Carlson, who has previously been employed at CNN and MSNBC, used to be your average right-wing mouthpiece, but in the last few years he has taken to spewing white nationalism. He tried to claim rap music, promoted the false narrative about white South African farmers being attacked, attacked immigrants and has also claimed that diversity is not improving the country. The only thing he hasn’t done at this stage is wear a hood and burn a cross on set.Carlson’s racist ranting is attracting the attention of the alt-right blogosphere.According to Columbia Journalism Review, “Other vocal fans of Carlson include Richard Spencer, David Duke, and white nationalist website The Daily Stormer. On August 24, 2018, The Daily Stormer published a post that noted gleefully, ‘Tucker Carlson is basically ‘Daily Stormer: The Show.’ Other than the language used, he is covering all of our talking points.”The Daily Stormer is a white supremacist website.However, the CJR article suggests that Carlson is a giant con. Although he portrays himself as the voice of downtrodden, blue-collar white men, Carlson comes from a wealthy family and is worth $8 million. But he realized there is a market for white rage.“According to Nielsen Media Research, the top-rated markets for the show are Ft. Myers, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; West Palm Beach, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; Birmingham, Alabama; Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Buffalo, New York. Only half of these cities went for Trump in the 2016 election, but they are (with the exception of Birmingham and Atlanta) overwhelmingly white and middle class, with an average age of 36. A large part of the jobs held by men in each city are in retail or construction,” said CJR writer Lyz Lenz."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Fucker-Carlson.pngc556b58bf9874473b6528e6570017c7a	[]	2018-09-15 00:00:00	Bakker: Extreme Weather is ‘Punishment For Letting Boys Wear Dresses’	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	Bakker: Extreme Weather is ‘Punishment For Letting Boys Wear Dresses’	0	"By Peter WestWith Hurricane Florence currently buffeting South Carolina, America and the world is beginning to see the effects of climate change which causes extreme weather.However, some right-wingers are determined to stick their heads in the sand and refuse to believe that climate change exists.Televangelist Jim Bakker said the storm is punishment from God for violating his laws.“I blame the transgenders for this. We didn’t see these kinds of storms when I was growing up,” said Bakker. “God is punishing us for allowing boys to wear dresses and women to pretend they are men.”He isn’t the only Christian fundamentalist who believes this. According to Right Wing Watch, pastor Rick Joyner also blamed extreme weather on sin.“More than dumping too much CO2 into the air or anything else, the scripture makes it clear what causes these things,” said Joyner. “It is sin. Sin, which is clearly defined in scripture. One of the worst things we could do to bring a curse on a nation is the shedding of innocent blood. What could be more innocent than the unborn? And look at what America is doing.”President Donald Trump has dismissed global warming as being a “Chinese hoax.” And some Republicans seem to have a hard time getting their facts straight about Hurricane Florence. Talk show host and former junkie Rush Limbaugh claimed the storm had sucked up sharks, which is the exact plot of the movie “Sharknado.”“This appeared somewhere. ‘Florence Now Contains Sharks.’ I’m telling you,” he said. “Sharks are being lifted out of the Atlantic Ocean and dumped into the storm because it’s so strong.

Deaths	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	Poll: 70 Percent of Trump Supporters Think Media Faked P.R. Deaths	0	"By Peter WestJust when you think that President Donald Trump can’t get worse, he proves you wrong,Recently he said that he didn’t believe the official death toll from Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico. The death toll has been recorded at about 3,000 people. However, Trump has declared his government’s relief mission was a resounding success and only about 18 people died.Trump supporters also back the president. According to an Occidental Public Polling survey, 70 percent of Trump supporters believe the media inflated the death toll to make the president looked bad.“The liberal media hates Trump and will do anything to make the president look bad,” said Don Callen, a Trump supporter from Tampa, Fla. “I reckon the media faked the numbers.”And there are other Trump cultists who also believe this.FOX News curmudgeon Lou Dobbs also backed the president.“Only President Trump has had the guts to call out the Dems and national left wing media types, who have blindly accepted an amazing tortured inflation of the death toll, almost 50 times higher than the original count, and with scant evidence to support any of it,” said Dobbs. “How does that count go from dozens in the days after the storm to almost 3,000 nearly a year later? Well, it involves as many academicians as humanly possible in the effort, and then you watch the entire exercise become a farce.”Also, Florida Gov. and Voldemort look-a-like Rick Scott felt the wrath of Trump cultists when he said the final death toll was more accurate. “I’ve been to Puerto Rico seven times and saw devastation firsthand,” said Scott in a tweet.But he was attacked by Trump supporters.“Stated like a politician running for a Senate seat. Trying to degrade @POTUS, who is under constant attack for EVERYTHING, doesn’t need someone he has helped tremendously trying to stick it to him. Not a good look on you,” said Carol Jordan Will."	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/640px-Morning_after_Hurricane_Maria_37372721465.jpg52ab178b74dc4948a05e9b6fab4916fa	[]	2018-09-13 00:00:00	Trump Supporters Want ‘Terrorist’ Kaepernick Executed Like Bin Laden	http://bizstandardnews.com/	US	Trump Supporters Want ‘Terrorist’ Kaepernick Executed Like Bin Laden	0	"By Piper BlackmunFormer NFL star Colin Kaepernick simply won’t go away, much to the chagrin of Trump supporters. He has become the face of Nike and has boosted their sales by 31 percent. But Trump supporters are furious.A Trump supporter in the Reddit group R_The Donald compared Kaepernick to Osama Bin Laden. “Kaepernick is just as bad as that turban topper, Bin Laden,” said Rusty43, “and we need to take care of him like Bin Laden. He needs to tried and executed for treason.”Rusty43 wasn’t the only Trump supporters infuriated by Kaepernick and the NFL protest he sparked. Former NFL player Burgess Owens accused Kaepernick of assaulting America.“We have to look at the bigger picture and understand in America that we’re under assault,” said Burgess in an appearance on FOX Business. “It’s like 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, we’re being assaulted by the left. And we need to understand who they are. They’re globalists, and they’re leftist globalists. The worst thing that can happen to our country is to let them get away with it and not understand what their long game is.”Burgess also accused Kaepernick of being a “marxist.”“As we see a little less of the kneeling, we’re still going to see the narrative by Nike,” said Owens, who is now a conservative commentator. “And that is a Marxist, who is going to be the face and commercial of the NFL going forward.”Meanwhile, the protest against Kaepernick continues. Ben Zahn, mayor of Kenner, La. has banned Nike products from city facilities. “Under no circumstances will any Nike product or any product with the Nike logo be purchased for use or delivery at any city of Kenner Recreation Facility,” said Kenner in a memo.He also added, “My decision is only to protect taxpayer dollars from being used in a political campaign. Some have asked if people will be allowed to wear Nike apparel on city playgrounds. The answer to that is … of course.”"	https://bizstandardnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kaepernick-e1536793956757.jpg7f4c4e55494848698ec70d9d8a333b15	['View All Posts Trenz.Today', 'Author', 'Trending Stories', 'Breaking News.

At the official opening of the park, he declared, “Eastern Turkestan is not only the home of the Turkic peoples but also the cradle of Turkic history, civilization and culture. To forget that would lead to the ignorance of our own history, civilization and culture. The martyrs of Eastern Turkestan are our martyrs”.These people are known by the name Uyghur, and they live in the far Western province of Xinjiang, China. They are Chinese citizens, but from an ethnic minority. In 2009 deadly violence erupted there; however, the Chinese authorities had mentioned earlier in 2002, that a radical Islamic terrorist group, which was supported by foreign sources and under the umbrella of al Qaeda, had been carrying out terrorist attacks in China.Who are these terrorists and how did they manage to form a base of operations in Idlib, Syria?Terror’s ‘Silk Road’The East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) operates as the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP), which is also known as “Katibat Turkistani.” Osama Bin Laden pledged his support for the group during a 1999 meeting in Afghanistan. Its members have trained with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The US Department of State labeled ETIM as a foreign terrorist organization. On July 28, 2016, TIP became an official faction of Jabhat Al Nusra, which is an al-Qaeda organisation in Syria.Addition to Turkey’s own role since 2011 in facilitating the build-up of militant armies in southern Turkey, President Erdogan of firmly backed the US covert operations during the terrorist attacks on Syria, beginning in 2011. Turkey officially became the transit point of all international terrorists with a final destination of Syria. Recent scandal reveal the sophistication of the organized smuggling rings being run in and out if Syria via Turkey. The Turkish airlines and airports were full of passengers going on Jihad. The Turkish businesses were making money hand-over-fist on everything from taxis, hotel rooms, and food; all the way to organ transplants, which were the by-product of the unwilling Syrian donors who were slaughtered.Another plan was formulated by the Turkish authorities, saw the issuance of Turkish passports to scores of Uyghurs, where they would leave China on international flights, with their destination being Istanbul, Turkey. Along the journey, some Uyghur were held for questioning in Indonesia, and elsewhere. The authorities there were suspicious of their Turkish passports, being held by persons who looked Chinese. When confronted, they insisted they were Turkish citizens traveling as tourists in Asia. The Indonesian officials summoned the Turkish Embassy, and they surprisingly confirmed they were Turkish. The Turkish immigration clerks at the airport were trained to identify these special passports, and confiscate them. Thus, once in, the Uyghurs would not be able to leave Turkey, guaranteeing they would be stuck in Idlib, Syria on jihad duty whilst indirectly under the control of the Turkish government.Brothers-in-Arms: Uyghurs pictured among some of the worst terrorists in Syria (Image Source: Sindo News)Turkey’s ‘Second Islamic State’ in IdlibBased on the process of events, it would appear that Erdogan’s plan depended on altering Syrian demographics; by repopulating Idlib province with jihadist Chinese Uyghurs, who attacked Syrian homeowners and farmers, causing them to flee and thus abandoning their properties to the foreigners. The Turkish President has a vision of a new Turcic colony annexed to Turkey.Much has been written about President Erdogan’s mercenary army of Uyghurs, who have been in Idlib for years. The Uyghur mentality does not fit the stereotype of their fellow ISIS and Al Qaeda brothers-in-arms. The Uyghurs insist on living in their traditional family order. They didn’t invade Syria alone: they came with wives, children and parents. Full multi-generational families are living in the rural Idlib countryside. They established schools for their children, who are taught in the Turcic language, which is the original root of the modern Turkish language. They occupied homes and farms which are owned by Syrian families who were made homeless by these Chinese Jihadis.Zanbaqi is a village located near Jisr al-Shughur, just out of Idlib. The tiny hamlet’s residents numbered just 752 in the Syrian national census taken in 2004. However, today there are about 3,500 Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) militants and their families living there, with their military camps training hundreds of children from these families. TIP trains not only Uighur children, but local children to be “little jihadists.” Zanbaqi now looks more like China than Damascus. Katibat al Ghuraba, or Katibat al Ghuraba al Turkistan (KGT) came to light in July 2017, when their YouTube videos of combat, weapons use, and a training camp/ school for children were uploaded.Sadly, there are many reports of foreign terrorists, including Uzbek and Uyghurs grooming children for the next generation of jihad:To the people of #Idlib If these international terrorists don't care about their own children, and brought them to die in a warzone Then what makes you think they care about your children? Time to kick them out! pic.twitter.com/VHmiNnzWj3 — The'Nimr'Tiger 🇸🇾🇸🇨 (@Souria4Syrians) September 10, 2018Syria’s ambassador in Beijing, Imad Moustapha, declared up to 5,000 ethnic Uyghurs from China were in Syria fighting alongside armed jihadists as of May 2017. For anyone who has actually followed real reporting on the ground in Syria, you would know that Uyghurs are among the most violent of all the various fighting groups in Syria. The mere fact that they are alongside Jabhat al Nusra is telling, as they are considered to be the most feared terrorists in the field. On June 10, 2015 the Qalb Loze massacre was carried out as the Uyghurs participated hand-in-hand with their brothers-in-arms, slaughtering civilians. Churches and the Christian communities of Idlib region were not spared. Christians are a minority there, and the Uyghurs and their cohorts preyed upon these communities. They forced them out of their properties and damaged churches. Priests were beheaded and kidnapped.At the 6th round of Astana Talks, for the purpose of a political solution to the Syrian conflict, the 3 participating countries, Russia, Iran and Turkey, agreed to a de-escalation zone including Idlib, in September 2017. However, the ISIS and Al Qaeda affiliated terrorists groups were never included. The UN resolution 2254 clearly states all UN member states must fight terrorist groups, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, Jibhat al Nusra and other radical armed jihadists. Because Idlib has been home to thousands of foreign jihadists, as well as the very small community of Free Syrian Army (FSA), who the UN, USA, and NATO call “moderate rebels”; the “War on Terror” began by President George W. Bush was held in limbo. The Russian, Syrian and Iranian position was to follow international law, and the letter of the UN 2254, which makes it clear that fighting the ISIS and Al Qaeda, and their affiliates, is the only way forward, in the path to restoring peace and security to Idlib.Earlier this month, Russia’s special envoy on Syria Alexander Lavrentiev told reporters after talks in Geneva with UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, that it is up to Turkey to separate Islamist militants from the moderate opposition in Idlib. As it stands now, Russia and Turkey have negotiated a peaceful impasse which, if it holds, may avert what would certainly be a bloody affair in the final battle.The other half of the story in Idlib is missing in mainstream media. Where is the story of millions of civilian hostages and human shields who have suffered in Idlib since the terrorist occupation in began in 2013? What about the men prevented from leaving, where residents were threatened with death if they didn’t stay to defend Idlib from the final battle? Note how as the last battle in Idlib was approaching, civilians report the terrorists were not allowing them to leave. What about the women used as slaves by the terrorists and foreign interlopers? What about the children prevented from accessing normal education and forced into servitude by the terrorists? Those stories will eventually be told the survivors. Either way, the real untold stories of Idlib will come out – much to the chagrin of propaganda outlets like CNN and others who have taken it upon themselves to be the PR adjuncts of al Qaeda in Idlib.We currently see Uyghurs living abroad in USA being interviewed on mainstream western media. They are adept at getting their message to Western audiences, who are sympathetic to the plight of the under-dog, and the ‘freedom fighter’ stance so dear to American revolutionary cultural mythos. This was followed by the proverbial Uyghur wave which swept across the Western and Gulf media, with well-known mainstream commentators all chiming-in (at the same time) with words of solidarity for the Uyghurs in China, and not surprisingly, none of them will mentioned the violent Western and Gulf-backed terrorist army encamped in Idlib:One million Muslim Uighurs may have been detained by the Chinese government – where’s the global outrage?

Eurasia will be the battle ground, and disrupting the Belt and Road project seems to be the raison d’etre of that effort. Westerners need to ask themselves if they would like armed terrorists living next door to them (or with them, in the case of Syria), but if they terrorize people in Syria or China that is alright as far as the western mainstream polity is concerned. In that inverted reality, the terrorist becomes the victim under the mainstream media.On August 1, 2018, the Chinese Ambassador to Damascus, Qi Qianjin, said that the Chinese military would be willing to participate in the battle in Idlib, while expressing regret that Chinese Uyghurs were involved as terrorists. Bearing all this in mind, no should really be surprised then that China and Russia joined-up to stage the largest military exercise in those two country’s history:China participating in giant Russian military exercise. Tells you all you need to know about the ham-fisted ineptitude of recent Western diplomacy. Far from isolating Russia, it has drawn much closer to the next dominant superpower. — Craig Murray (@CraigMurrayOrg) September 11, 2018When it’s all said and done, history may look back at Syria as another Western regime change debacle. But even if that’s true, as with Afghanistan and Kosovo, their Mujahideen will simply be re-deployed to a new theater.Then the real question is: will Operation Cyclone ever end?***21WIRE Special Contributor Steven Sahiounie is an American citizen born in Fresno, California.

I concluded with president Putin that teams from both armies will meet again soon,” Netanyahu said.“We will do whatever it takes in order to ensure Israel’s security,” he added.READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files SUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-Netanyahu.jpg2dd4680734fd497c92b5278536a867f3	[]	2018-09-25 00:00:00	Rod Rosenstein Could Be Ousted by Trump – ‘Russiagate’ Fanatics Are Going Crazy	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Rod Rosenstein Could Be Ousted by Trump – ‘Russiagate’ Fanatics Are Going Crazy	0	"ByU.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who most notably overseas special counsel Robert Mueller’s ‘Trump-Russia’ investigation, could lose his job this week, according to multiple reports.Over the last year and a half on the job, Rosenstein has allowed Mueller the leeway to conduct his far-flung and open-ended Russiagate investigation while appearing to show deference to President Donald Trump who nominated him for his current post at the Department of Justice (DOJ).He has been criticized for allowing political bias to creep into the DOJ and its dealings with other federal agencies, including the FBI, regarding President Trump and the Russia investigation.In December of 2017, Rosenstein appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee amid questions about Anti-Trump text messages sent by FBI employees assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Rosenstein testified that Mueller was running his office “appropriately” and without bias, prompting one committee member to suggest Mueller’s team should be attired with ’Democratic donkey jerseys’ and ‘I’m with Hillary t-shirts’.And just this past week, a New York Times report claimed Rosenstein “suggested last year that he secretly record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration, and he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office for being unfit.”Not surprisingly, the ‘Russiagate’-aligned media, to include CNN, has been thrown into a frenzy of speculation, with one top Democrat calling the situation a “slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre.”Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), a longtime Russiagate provocateur on the cable news network, also weighed in on cue, touting the “independence of the DOJ”:Under no circumstances should Rod Rosenstein resign. This would place the Mueller investigation in even greater jeopardy. Rosenstein should continue to do his job, protect the independence of the DOJ, and if the President intends to obstruct justice, force Trump to fire him. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2018Rosenstein disputes the claims made in the NYT report:“The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect, […] I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda.”Trump plans to meet with Rosenstein on Thursday, undoubtedly to decide his fate at the DOJ.READ MORE RUSSIAGATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire RussiaGate FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Thirteen_Russian_RR_DOJ-e1537850676838.jpgce0307cbe3c84aa69d7bc7a2c0807493	['Jay Dyer']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Lil Peep, David Lynch, Twin Peaks & Metaphysics	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Lil Peep, David Lynch, Twin Peaks & Metaphysics	0	"ByJay Dyer21st Century WireWicca Phase Springs Eternal has garnered tens of millions of views on YouTube in the last few years and after his collaborations and major hits with the now deceased Lil’ Peep, has exploded in popularity.

Iranian researcher Dr. Mohamed Sadiq al-Husseini wrote that according to Iranian intelligence sources revealed that the terrorist attack of Ahvaz city was conducted in coordination between the “People’s Mojahedin Organization” of Iran or the “Mojahedin-e Khalq” [MEK] and the “Ahwazia” an Arab-Iranian separatist group with alleged connections to Saudi Arabia, also known as the “Ahvaz National Resistance”.It’s no secret the U.S. national security establishment and its neocon conclave have anointed this shady terrorist organization, the notorious MEK, to assume the reigns of power in Iran in the event of a regime change.President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, openly talks about Iran regime change every chance he gets.“It could be in a few days, months, a couple of years. But it’s going to happen,” Giuliani said at the “Iran Uprising Summit” event in New York on Saturday.Since the Ahvaz terror attack, which killed 25 people, the Iranian government has vowed ‘revenge’ against the U.S. and its allies who support MEK, an organization that in 2012 was delisted from the U.S. State Department’s designated terror list by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Read more about this story from Marwa Osman at AlahedNews…READ MORE IRAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iran FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER

for Secret Military Program	0	"ByEarlier this year, 21WIRE published the journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva’s previous reports detailing the Pentagon’s extensive overseas biological and chemical weapons facilities in eastern Europe and central Asia, and at Porton Down in the UK.In her latest investigation, we learn about the Pentagon’s biolaboratory in the Republic of Georgia’s capital Tbilisi, and the diplomatic cover provided to traffick in “human blood and pathogens for a secret military program.”Editor’s Note: A special report and preview of the documentary film aired first on Al Mayadeen TV – watch the Arabic language version below. 21WIRE plans to release a series of special English language video reports at 21st Century Wire and 21WIRE.TV.By Dilyana Gaytandzhieva21st Century WireSPECIAL REPORTThe US Embassy to Tbilisi transports frozen human blood and pathogens as diplomatic cargo for a secret US military program. Internal documents, implicating US diplomats in the transportation of and experimenting on pathogens under diplomatic cover were leaked to me by Georgian insiders. According to these documents, Pentagon scientists have been deployed to the Republic of Georgia and have been given diplomatic immunity to research deadly diseases and biting insects at the Lugar Center – the Pentagon biolaboratory in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi.This military facility is just one of the many Pentagon biolaboratories in 25 countries across the world. They are funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under a $ 2.1 billion military program – Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP), and are located in former Soviet Union countries such as Georgia and Ukraine, the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa.The Pentagon biolaboratory is heavily guarded. All passers-by within a radius of 100 m are filmed although the military biolaboratory is located within a residential area.The security guards warn me that if I do not comply, show my passport and leave this place, I will be arrested. My official request to the Lugar Center for access to the facility and for interviews has also been rejected.Secret experiments at nightHowever, I go back at night when the laboratory is seemingly still working. No matter how far the distance the air is laden with the smell of chemicals. This smell coming from the Lugar Center at night is blown by the wind to the residential area. Local residents from the Alexeevka neighbourhood, where the laboratory is located, complain that dangerous chemicals are being secretly burnt at night and that hazardous waste is being emptied into the nearby river through the laboratory’s pipes.Locals complain of constant headaches, nausea, high blood pressure and dizziness when chemicals are being burnt at night in the laboratory which is just a couple of hundred meters from their homes.“There is a smoke – black, red, green at night or especially early in the morning at around 3, 4 a.m. Even the hens have died. They put a big pipe underground and connected it to the drains. This smell comes from there. It smells like rotten eggs and decaying hay. The smell is so bad and is spread in different directions by the wind”, says Eteri Gogitidze who lives in a block of flats next to the laboratory.“Sometimes the wind spreads a smell of rotten eggs. Once I woke up early in the morning and noticed violet smoke coming from the laboratory. At night time they let the smoke out so that people don’t see. Why at night, what are they hiding from us?, he asks and then provides another worrying fact: “There are big blue plastic pipes along this street (from the laboratory) and from where everything goes to the river which is 3-4 km away. Not only do they pollute our air, but they also poison our water.”Locals: Poisonous gas killed two FilipinosNeighbours recall a tragic incident involving four Filipinos who worked at the Lugar Center. Two of the foreigners died of an alleged gas poisoning in their rented flat in block 44 of the Alexeevka Settlement.“The first time when they called the Emergency service we were told that they had food poisoning from fish. But the second time when the ambulance came there was foam coming out of their mouths. They were shouting: “Help, Help!” When they passed away, they took them away and covered it all up. It all happened here”, Albert Nurbekyan shows the sealed off flat where the foreign scientists died.Another witness, Elvira Ratiani who lived next door witnessed the foreigners die before her eyes. “They were my neighbors, we lived on the same floor, and once they were poisoned, and asked us to call the Emergency service. We phoned and the Emergency service saved them. They said it was probably fish poisoning. The second time, they knocked on the door and again asked for help. There were four Filipinos, two of them were saved, but the other two died”, recalls Elvira Ratiani who lives in the fatal block 44 of the Alexeevka Settlement right next to the laboratory.Human blood and pathogens as diplomatic cargo to the US Embassy – leaked documentsInternal documents and correspondence between the Ministry of Health of Georgia and the US Embassy to Tbilisi show what experiments have been conducted at the Lugar Center. Leaked documents reveal that the US Embassy to Tbilisi transports pathogens, as well as frozen human blood, as diplomatic cargo.Diplomatic cargo shipments are exempt from inspection and taxes. According to instructions from The Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which oversees and funds the laboratories, biological material for the needs of the program must be shipped as hand-carrying items to the US embassies.In cases of importing to Russia, this biological material must be carried by diplomats in a diplomatic pouch and sealed as diplomatic cargo.The Pentagon: Prostitutes strictly prohibited, no sex abroadOther instructions to US personnel working under the military program prohibit the use of prostitutes, and any interaction with individuals who may reasonably be assumed to be working as prostitutes.Romantic, intimate or sexual relations with local citizens or among team members are strongly discouraged as “foreign security services are known to use the enticement of such relations to exploit foreign officials”. As such, a relationship with foreign nationals must be reported to DTRA as soon as possible, the document reads.US scientists test viruses under diplomatic immunityTasked with the program at the Lugar Center are biologists from the US Army Medical Research Unit-Georgia (USAMRU-G) along with private American contractors and the US Center for Disease Control (CDC). Certain zones of the laboratory are classified zones and are accessible only to American citizens with security clearance. They are accorded diplomatic immunity under the 2002 US-Georgia Agreement on defense cooperation.Joshua Bast is the deputy director of the US Army Medical Research Unit-Georgia (USAMRU-G). The American military scientist drives a diplomatic car and enjoys diplomatic immunity, without being a diplomat.He has been deployed to Georgia since 2015 by the Pentagon Walter Reeds Army Institute of Research. His military unit also operates a separate laboratory inside the Lugar Center – the Walter Reeds Army Institute of research laboratory. However, when I confront him at the entrance of the laboratory, he flatly denies that he works at the Lugar Center.However, leaked e-mails between the Pentagon and the Georgian Ministry of Health (below) proves him wrong. Joshua Bast does work at the Lugar Center.Joshua Bast is the deputy director of USAMRU-Georgia, according to leaked correspondence between the Pentagon medical research unit in Georgia and the Georgian Health Ministry. The address of USAMRU-Georgia indicated in this official e-mail (above) is the address of the Lugar Center (16 Kakheti Highway, Tbilisi).Why does a Pentagon employee lie about his workplace? I have not received any answer. Joshua Bast drives off immediately after being challenged. He is not the only US non-diplomat working on the Pentagon program, who has been accorded diplomatic immunity. There are six diplomatic cars in the car park of the laboratory, all of them with registration plates of the US Embassy.After I refuse to comply the security guards jump into an unmarked car. But I manage to escape.These security guards patrolling the area around the laboratory in an unmarked car are paid for by the Pentagon and not by the government of Georgia, according to information obtained from the US Federal Contract registry. Hence, Georgia has no control over the activities of its foreign sponsor. Furthermore, the Pentagon scientists can work in direct violation of international law.International law is not applicableUnder a 3 year-long agreement between the Walter Reeds Army Institute and the Georgian National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), the Pentagon has been given full access to the local collection of deadly bio agents in order to study them. These are agents which can cause Anthrax, Tularemia, Brucella and plague.According to the agreement’s provisions, “international law is not applicable to this Agreement, the parties agree that no court, tribunal or international entity has jurisdiction or authority to consider or provide judgement in case of disputes arising between the parties of this agreement”.Drone for releasing of toxic mosquitoesThe work that US diplomats perform at the Lugar Center has nothing to do with diplomacy and does not fall under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Joshua Bast, for instance, is an entomologist and researches insects, according to a video released by the US Embassy to promote the peaceful purposes of the otherwise military program of the US in Georgia.Why does an entomologist work for the US Army and why is he accorded diplomatic immunity? Entomological warfare is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to transmit diseases. Georgia borders on the US main rival – Russia. Moscow has repeatedly voiced its concerns about the potential development of biological weapons near the Russian borders, including the spread of diseases through insects.Such fears are not groundless, considering a recent US patent for a Toxic Mosquito Aerial release system, granted by The United States Patent and Trademark Office in 2014. The invention includes a drone which can release infected mosquitoes.According to the patent documents, the drone is capable of delivering lethal and non-lethal toxins, including any agent that can be carried and administered by a mosquito.The inventor of the drone for the releasing of toxic mosquitoes S. Mill Calvert has patented 42 similar military inventions for the US Army and Special forces, including stroke-inducing bullets ,in a span of just two years from 2013 to 2015. A person with such a name however does not exist in the US citizens registry. The US patent Lawyer, Louis Ventre, who filed the application, declined to comment if this name was a pseudonym and who his client actually was (the e-mails below).Documents show a number of Pentagon projects involving insects as possible vectors of diseases in Georgia. In 2014 The Lugar Center was equipped with an insect facility and launched a project on Sand Flies in Georgia and the Caucasus. In 2014-2015 sand fly species were collected under another project “Surveillance Work on Acute Febrile Illness” and all (female) sand flies were tested to determine their infectivity rate. A third project, also including sand flies collection, studied the characteristics of their salivary glands. Sand flies carry dangerous parasites in their saliva which they can transmit to humans through a bite.Since the start of the project on flies at the Lugar Center Georgia has been infested with sand flies. Local people complain of being bitten by these newly appeared flies while naked in their bathrooms (a fly in a bathroom on the right).The Pentagon scientists have also performed experiments involving tropical mosquitos and ticks in Georgia. In 2016, 21 590 ticks were collected for a DNA database for future studies at The Lugar Center under the Pentagon project “Assessing the Seroprevalence and Genetic Diversity of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) and Hantaviruses in Georgia”. The Pentagon projects involving ticks coincided with an inexplicable outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) which is caused by infection through a tick-borne virus. In 2014 34 people became infected (amongst which a 4-year old child). A total of 60 cases with 9 fatalities have been registered in Georgia since 2009, according to a leaked e-mail sent by the Lugar Center director Amiran Gamkrelidze to the Minister of Health of Georgia David Sergeenko.White Powder over ChechnyaThe Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which runs the US military program at the Lugar Center in Georgia, is alleged to have already performed field tests with an unknown substance in Chechnya, Russia. In June 2017 local citizens reported on a drone disseminating white powder close to the Russian border with Georgia.A local resident from a village in Chechnya close to the Russia-Georgia border shows traces of white powder on his car, which he says is regularly spread in the area.The Pentagon does have drones for powder dissemination of biological agents, according to information obtained from the US Federal contracts registry. Such field tests involving drones for bio-agent dispersion have been performed since 2012 at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. The military facility not only produces live bio agents which includes anthrax, botulinum toxin, tularemia, etc. under the pretext of studying them, but also disseminates them though aerosol, powder and explosives, as proven in a 2012 US Army Report.US Army documents and photos show that the Pentagon has developed various dissemination methods for bioterrorism attacks including by explosives.Besides having various military capabilities to disperse bio agents, DTRA has also full access to the Russian borders, granted under a military program called Georgia Land Border Security Project. The activities, related to this project have been outsourced to a private American company – Parsons Government Services International. Parsons has been awarded a $17.7 million contract under the Pentagon border security project in Georgia. DTRA has previously contracted Parsons for similar border security projects in Lebanon, Jordan, Libya and Syria. Interestingly, a subcontractor working on this border security project – TMC Global Professional Services, also happens to be contracted by DTRA for scientific support at the Lugar Center. The same American company – TMC, which works at the Lugar Center also carries out surveillance for WMD on the Georgian borders. The project coincides with the incident involving powder dissemination which was reported and filmed in neighbouring Chechnya close to the Georgian border.Private contractorsThe Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has outsourced much of the work under the military program to private companies, which are not accountable to Congress, and which can operate more freely and move around the rule of law.TMC was awarded a $3.8 million contract in 2016 running until 2021 for support services at the Lugar Center. Interestingly, the same year the same private company was awarded another $975 million counter narcoterrorism contract by the Pentagon. Why has a company, which works for the Pentagon on a program to counter narcotics, been concurrently given work at a military laboratory which burns chemicals at night?Leaked documents reveal another company involved in the program in Georgia – Booz Allen Hamilton.Snowden’s former employer – Booz Allen Hamilton, has been awarded five lucrative contracts by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) since 2010 running until 2022, totaling at least $ 358 million for intelligence support and chemical weapons agents support services. According to the company’s website it has developed a web-based platform for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the US intelligence community. The system currently holds more than 9 terabytes of intelligence data and grows by about 1.5 million records every week.The Pentagon has spent at least $161 million on the Lugar Center in Tbilisi under a contract with the private American contractor – CH2M Hill. This is half of the total sum of $ 361.4 million that the company had been awarded to operate Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and South East Asia.According to CH2M Hill, the US company has secured biological agents and employed former bio warfare scientists at The Lugar Center. These are scientists who are working for another American company involved in the military program in Georgia – Battelle Memorial Institute.Battelle as a $59 million subcontractor at the Lugar Center has extensive experience in research on bio-agents, as the company has already worked on the US Bio-weapons Program under 11 previous contracts with the US Army in the past. Source: US Army Activities in the US, Biological Warfare Programs, vol. II, 1977, p. 82The same company also worked for the CIA under the Project Clear Vision (1997-200) Its stated goal was to reconstruct a Soviet-era anthrax bomblet in order to test its dissemination characteristics. The clandestine CIA-Battelle operation was omitted from the US Biological Weapons Convention declarations submitted to the UN.The inauguration of the Lugar Center in Tbilisi in 2011. Andrew C. Weber (on the right) –then US Assistant Secretary of Defense (2009-2014), US DoD Deputy Coordinator for Ebola Response (2014-2015), is currently a Metabiota (the US contractor) employee.The US Company Metabiota Inc. has been awarded $23.9 million in federal contracts under the Pentagon’s DTRA program in Georgia and Ukraine for scientific and technical consulting services. Metabiota had been contracted to perform work for DTRA befor and during the Ebola crisis in West Africa and was awarded $3.2 million (2012-2015) for work in Sierra Leone at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.Journalist expelled from the European Parliament for confronting US official on bioweaponsI asked US Assistant Secretary of Health Robert Kadlec for a comment during a conference on biological weapons at the European Parliament in Brussels and was immediately expelled from the conference.How a journalist gets expelled from the European Parliament when asking the Assistant Secretary at the US Department of Health questions about the Pentagon bio laboratories around Russia, China and Iran. Posted by Dilyana Gaytandzhieva on Wednesday, March 7, 2018Ethnic BioweaponsDocuments reveal some of the projects funded by the Pentagon. Among them projects related to Russia. The US Air Force has been specifically collecting Russian RNA and synovial tissue samples raising fears in Moscow of a covert US ethnic bio-weapons program.The Pentagon has also studied the Russian Anthrax Strain at the Lugar Center for which Russia has a vaccine, a Russian Yersinia pestis Strain (which causes plague), as well as the Genome sequence of the Russian Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strain.Leaked e-mails, between the director of the Lugar Center Amiran Gamkrelidze and the Minister of Health of Georgia David Sergeenko, also reveal an ongoing Pentagon project on Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever in the country.Georgians used as laboratory rabbitsThe minister’s e-mails also reveal another American project on Hepatitis C in Georgia including cases of death. The pilot study of the US Center for Disease Control in Georgia is called “Simplified Diagnostics and Monitoring of Hepatitis C Infected Patients in Rural Primary Care Settings Using Newly Approved Pan-Genotypic Antiviral Therapy”. It is designated as confidential information. The Ministry of Health of Georgia has signed an Agreement with the US Center for Disease Control and the private American pharmaceutical company Gilead. According to this agreement, the American side provides free medicines for Hepatitis C treatment. In exchange, the private American company cannot be held accountable for any damage (intentional or not) which may result from the program. The agreement is signed by David Sergeenko from the Georgian side.From Paris with loveLeaked e-mails between minister Sergeenko and the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) which supports the program on Hepatitic C in Georgia reveal private meetings in Paris between the government officials and Gilead.Confidential reports: At least 100 death cases in GeorgiaLeaked confidential documents show at least 100 deaths reported to Gilead, over the last 3 years, of patients under treatment with the Gilead drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni which had been provided to them for free.Georgians have been used as laboratory rabbits for a new Hepatitis C experimental treatment by the private American company along with the US Center for Disease Control. Moreover, in some of the death cases reports sent to Gilead from the Georgian Ministry of Health the cause of death is indicated as unknown or not related to the treatment. 30 Georgians died during the drug clinical trials in December 2015 alone. Another 30 death cases were reported in April 2016, also in the span of only a month. It is worth noting that the drugs are neither emergency resuscitation drugs for patients in clinical death condition, nor cancer palliative drugs. Most causes of death remain obscure and some diagnoses do not correlate with the International Classification of Diseases by WHO.30 cases of death were reported in April 2016 alone. According to the reports, however, the cause of death was not linked to the treatment or was unknown.To make things worse, the US government agency has launched the ostensibly altruistic project on free medicines for the poor Georgian people in partnership with the private American company Gilead thus being in direct conflict of interest. A financial report for 2017 reveals that the same company Gilead is among the main sponsors of the Center for Disease Control Foundation.The biggest shareholder in Gilead is the former US Minister of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.On 5 September 2018, the Anticorruption Department of the Georgian National Security Agency announced that it had launched an investigation into the Hepatitis C program.The US-funded Lugar Center in Tbilisi may have been involved in illegal experiments on Georgian citizens, the country’s former security minister Igor Giorgadze has claimed, citing leaked documents he obtained. He said he managed to acquire over 100,000 pages of documents about the research done at the Richard Lugar Center.The minister of Health of Georgia David Sergeenko did not respond to my questions. The leaked e-mails though show the minister’s reaction.Coincidentally I was inexplicably locked up in the bedroom of my rented flat in Tbilisi while sleeping and was freed by Emergency services who accessed the locked room through the roof.How I was locked up in the bedroom of my rented flat in #Tbilisi while investigating a US military program including a pilot study with 100 death cases reports.

Internal documents, implicating US diplomats in the transportation of and experimenting on pathogens under diplomatic cover were leaked to me by Georgian insiders. According to these documents, Pentagon scientists have been deployed to the Republic of Georgia and have been given diplomatic immunity to research deadly diseases and biting insects at the Lugar Center – the Pentagon biolaboratory in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi.This military facility is just one of the many Pentagon biolaboratories in 25 countries across the world. They are funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under a $ 2.1 billion military program – Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP), and are located in former Soviet Union countries such as Georgia and Ukraine, the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa.The Pentagon biolaboratory is heavily guarded. All passers-by within a radius of 100 m are filmed although the military biolaboratory is located within a residential area.The security guards warn me that if I do not comply, show my passport and leave this place, I will be arrested. My official request to the Lugar Center for access to the facility and for interviews has also been rejected.Secret experiments at nightHowever, I go back at night when the laboratory is seemingly still working. No matter how far the distance the air is laden with the smell of chemicals. This smell coming from the Lugar Center at night is blown by the wind to the residential area. Local residents from the Alexeevka neighbourhood, where the laboratory is located, complain that dangerous chemicals are being secretly burnt at night and that hazardous waste is being emptied into the nearby river through the laboratory’s pipes.Locals complain of constant headaches, nausea, high blood pressure and dizziness when chemicals are being burnt at night in the laboratory which is just a couple of hundred meters from their homes.“There is a smoke – black, red, green at night or especially early in the morning at around 3, 4 a.m. Even the hens have died. They put a big pipe underground and connected it to the drains. This smell comes from there. It smells like rotten eggs and decaying hay. The smell is so bad and is spread in different directions by the wind”, says Eteri Gogitidze who lives in a block of flats next to the laboratory.“Sometimes the wind spreads a smell of rotten eggs. Once I woke up early in the morning and noticed violet smoke coming from the laboratory. At night time they let the smoke out so that people don’t see. Why at night, what are they hiding from us?, he asks and then provides another worrying fact: “There are big blue plastic pipes along this street (from the laboratory) and from where everything goes to the river which is 3-4 km away. Not only do they pollute our air, but they also poison our water.”Locals: Poisonous gas killed two FilipinosNeighbours recall a tragic incident involving four Filipinos who worked at the Lugar Center. Two of the foreigners died of an alleged gas poisoning in their rented flat in block 44 of the Alexeevka Settlement.“The first time when they called the Emergency service we were told that they had food poisoning from fish. But the second time when the ambulance came there was foam coming out of their mouths. They were shouting: “Help, Help!” When they passed away, they took them away and covered it all up. It all happened here”, Albert Nurbekyan shows the sealed off flat where the foreign scientists died.Another witness, Elvira Ratiani who lived next door witnessed the foreigners die before her eyes. “They were my neighbors, we lived on the same floor, and once they were poisoned, and asked us to call the Emergency service. We phoned and the Emergency service saved them. They said it was probably fish poisoning. The second time, they knocked on the door and again asked for help. There were four Filipinos, two of them were saved, but the other two died”, recalls Elvira Ratiani who lives in the fatal block 44 of the Alexeevka Settlement right next to the laboratory.Human blood and pathogens as diplomatic cargo to the US Embassy – leaked documentsInternal documents and correspondence between the Ministry of Health of Georgia and the US Embassy to Tbilisi show what experiments have been conducted at the Lugar Center. Leaked documents reveal that the US Embassy to Tbilisi transports pathogens, as well as frozen human blood, as diplomatic cargo.Diplomatic cargo shipments are exempt from inspection and taxes. According to instructions from The Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which oversees and funds the laboratories, biological material for the needs of the program must be shipped as hand-carrying items to the US embassies.In cases of importing to Russia, this biological material must be carried by diplomats in a diplomatic pouch and sealed as diplomatic cargo.The Pentagon: Prostitutes strictly prohibited, no sex abroadOther instructions to US personnel working under the military program prohibit the use of prostitutes, and any interaction with individuals who may reasonably be assumed to be working as prostitutes.Romantic, intimate or sexual relations with local citizens or among team members are strongly discouraged as “foreign security services are known to use the enticement of such relations to exploit foreign officials”. As such, a relationship with foreign nationals must be reported to DTRA as soon as possible, the document reads.US scientists test viruses under diplomatic immunityTasked with the program at the Lugar Center are biologists from the US Army Medical Research Unit-Georgia (USAMRU-G) along with private American contractors and the US Center for Disease Control (CDC). Certain zones of the laboratory are classified zones and are accessible only to American citizens with security clearance. They are accorded diplomatic immunity under the 2002 US-Georgia Agreement on defense cooperation.Joshua Bast is the deputy director of the US Army Medical Research Unit-Georgia (USAMRU-G). The American military scientist drives a diplomatic car and enjoys diplomatic immunity, without being a diplomat.He has been deployed to Georgia since 2015 by the Pentagon Walter Reeds Army Institute of Research. His military unit also operates a separate laboratory inside the Lugar Center – the Walter Reeds Army Institute of research laboratory. However, when I confront him at the entrance of the laboratory, he flatly denies that he works at the Lugar Center.However, leaked e-mails between the Pentagon and the Georgian Ministry of Health (below) proves him wrong. Joshua Bast does work at the Lugar Center.Joshua Bast is the deputy director of USAMRU-Georgia, according to leaked correspondence between the Pentagon medical research unit in Georgia and the Georgian Health Ministry. The address of USAMRU-Georgia indicated in this official e-mail (above) is the address of the Lugar Center (16 Kakheti Highway, Tbilisi).Why does a Pentagon employee lie about his workplace? I have not received any answer. Joshua Bast drives off immediately after being challenged. He is not the only US non-diplomat working on the Pentagon program, who has been accorded diplomatic immunity. There are six diplomatic cars in the car park of the laboratory, all of them with registration plates of the US Embassy.After I refuse to comply the security guards jump into an unmarked car. But I manage to escape.These security guards patrolling the area around the laboratory in an unmarked car are paid for by the Pentagon and not by the government of Georgia, according to information obtained from the US Federal Contract registry. Hence, Georgia has no control over the activities of its foreign sponsor. Furthermore, the Pentagon scientists can work in direct violation of international law.International law is not applicableUnder a 3 year-long agreement between the Walter Reeds Army Institute and the Georgian National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), the Pentagon has been given full access to the local collection of deadly bio agents in order to study them. These are agents which can cause Anthrax, Tularemia, Brucella and plague.According to the agreement’s provisions, “international law is not applicable to this Agreement, the parties agree that no court, tribunal or international entity has jurisdiction or authority to consider or provide judgement in case of disputes arising between the parties of this agreement”.Drone for releasing of toxic mosquitoesThe work that US diplomats perform at the Lugar Center has nothing to do with diplomacy and does not fall under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Joshua Bast, for instance, is an entomologist and researches insects, according to a video released by the US Embassy to promote the peaceful purposes of the otherwise military program of the US in Georgia.Why does an entomologist work for the US Army and why is he accorded diplomatic immunity? Entomological warfare is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to transmit diseases. Georgia borders on the US main rival – Russia. Moscow has repeatedly voiced its concerns about the potential development of biological weapons near the Russian borders, including the spread of diseases through insects.Such fears are not groundless, considering a recent US patent for a Toxic Mosquito Aerial release system, granted by The United States Patent and Trademark Office in 2014. The invention includes a drone which can release infected mosquitoes.According to the patent documents, the drone is capable of delivering lethal and non-lethal toxins, including any agent that can be carried and administered by a mosquito.The inventor of the drone for the releasing of toxic mosquitoes S. Mill Calvert has patented 42 similar military inventions for the US Army and Special forces, including stroke-inducing bullets ,in a span of just two years from 2013 to 2015. A person with such a name however does not exist in the US citizens registry. The US patent Lawyer, Louis Ventre, who filed the application, declined to comment if this name was a pseudonym and who his client actually was (the e-mails below).Documents show a number of Pentagon projects involving insects as possible vectors of diseases in Georgia. In 2014 The Lugar Center was equipped with an insect facility and launched a project on Sand Flies in Georgia and the Caucasus. In 2014-2015 sand fly species were collected under another project “Surveillance Work on Acute Febrile Illness” and all (female) sand flies were tested to determine their infectivity rate. A third project, also including sand flies collection, studied the characteristics of their salivary glands. Sand flies carry dangerous parasites in their saliva which they can transmit to humans through a bite.Since the start of the project on flies at the Lugar Center Georgia has been infested with sand flies. Local people complain of being bitten by these newly appeared flies while naked in their bathrooms (a fly in a bathroom on the right).The Pentagon scientists have also performed experiments involving tropical mosquitos and ticks in Georgia. In 2016, 21 590 ticks were collected for a DNA database for future studies at The Lugar Center under the Pentagon project “Assessing the Seroprevalence and Genetic Diversity of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) and Hantaviruses in Georgia”. The Pentagon projects involving ticks coincided with an inexplicable outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) which is caused by infection through a tick-borne virus. In 2014 34 people became infected (amongst which a 4-year old child). A total of 60 cases with 9 fatalities have been registered in Georgia since 2009, according to a leaked e-mail sent by the Lugar Center director Amiran Gamkrelidze to the Minister of Health of Georgia David Sergeenko.White Powder over ChechnyaThe Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which runs the US military program at the Lugar Center in Georgia, is alleged to have already performed field tests with an unknown substance in Chechnya, Russia. In June 2017 local citizens reported on a drone disseminating white powder close to the Russian border with Georgia.A local resident from a village in Chechnya close to the Russia-Georgia border shows traces of white powder on his car, which he says is regularly spread in the area.The Pentagon does have drones for powder dissemination of biological agents, according to information obtained from the US Federal contracts registry. Such field tests involving drones for bio-agent dispersion have been performed since 2012 at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. The military facility not only produces live bio agents which includes anthrax, botulinum toxin, tularemia, etc. under the pretext of studying them, but also disseminates them though aerosol, powder and explosives, as proven in a 2012 US Army Report.US Army documents and photos show that the Pentagon has developed various dissemination methods for bioterrorism attacks including by explosives.Besides having various military capabilities to disperse bio agents, DTRA has also full access to the Russian borders, granted under a military program called Georgia Land Border Security Project. The activities, related to this project have been outsourced to a private American company – Parsons Government Services International. Parsons has been awarded a $17.7 million contract under the Pentagon border security project in Georgia. DTRA has previously contracted Parsons for similar border security projects in Lebanon, Jordan, Libya and Syria. Interestingly, a subcontractor working on this border security project – TMC Global Professional Services, also happens to be contracted by DTRA for scientific support at the Lugar Center. The same American company – TMC, which works at the Lugar Center also carries out surveillance for WMD on the Georgian borders. The project coincides with the incident involving powder dissemination which was reported and filmed in neighbouring Chechnya close to the Georgian border.Private contractorsThe Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has outsourced much of the work under the military program to private companies, which are not accountable to Congress, and which can operate more freely and move around the rule of law.TMC was awarded a $3.8 million contract in 2016 running until 2021 for support services at the Lugar Center. Interestingly, the same year the same private company was awarded another $975 million counter narcoterrorism contract by the Pentagon. Why has a company, which works for the Pentagon on a program to counter narcotics, been concurrently given work at a military laboratory which burns chemicals at night?Leaked documents reveal another company involved in the program in Georgia – Booz Allen Hamilton.Snowden’s former employer – Booz Allen Hamilton, has been awarded five lucrative contracts by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) since 2010 running until 2022, totaling at least $ 358 million for intelligence support and chemical weapons agents support services. According to the company’s website it has developed a web-based platform for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the US intelligence community. The system currently holds more than 9 terabytes of intelligence data and grows by about 1.5 million records every week.The Pentagon has spent at least $161 million on the Lugar Center in Tbilisi under a contract with the private American contractor – CH2M Hill. This is half of the total sum of $ 361.4 million that the company had been awarded to operate Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and South East Asia.According to CH2M Hill, the US company has secured biological agents and employed former bio warfare scientists at The Lugar Center. These are scientists who are working for another American company involved in the military program in Georgia – Battelle Memorial Institute.Battelle as a $59 million subcontractor at the Lugar Center has extensive experience in research on bio-agents, as the company has already worked on the US Bio-weapons Program under 11 previous contracts with the US Army in the past. Source: US Army Activities in the US, Biological Warfare Programs, vol. II, 1977, p. 82The same company also worked for the CIA under the Project Clear Vision (1997-200) Its stated goal was to reconstruct a Soviet-era anthrax bomblet in order to test its dissemination characteristics. The clandestine CIA-Battelle operation was omitted from the US Biological Weapons Convention declarations submitted to the UN.The inauguration of the Lugar Center in Tbilisi in 2011. Andrew C. Weber (on the right) –then US Assistant Secretary of Defense (2009-2014), US DoD Deputy Coordinator for Ebola Response (2014-2015), is currently a Metabiota (the US contractor) employee.The US Company Metabiota Inc. has been awarded $23.9 million in federal contracts under the Pentagon’s DTRA program in Georgia and Ukraine for scientific and technical consulting services. Metabiota had been contracted to perform work for DTRA befor and during the Ebola crisis in West Africa and was awarded $3.2 million (2012-2015) for work in Sierra Leone at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.Journalist expelled from the European Parliament for confronting US official on bioweaponsI asked US Assistant Secretary of Health Robert Kadlec for a comment during a conference on biological weapons at the European Parliament in Brussels and was immediately expelled from the conference.How a journalist gets expelled from the European Parliament when asking the Assistant Secretary at the US Department of Health questions about the Pentagon bio laboratories around Russia, China and Iran. Posted by Dilyana Gaytandzhieva on Wednesday, March 7, 2018Ethnic BioweaponsDocuments reveal some of the projects funded by the Pentagon. Among them projects related to Russia. The US Air Force has been specifically collecting Russian RNA and synovial tissue samples raising fears in Moscow of a covert US ethnic bio-weapons program.The Pentagon has also studied the Russian Anthrax Strain at the Lugar Center for which Russia has a vaccine, a Russian Yersinia pestis Strain (which causes plague), as well as the Genome sequence of the Russian Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strain.Leaked e-mails, between the director of the Lugar Center Amiran Gamkrelidze and the Minister of Health of Georgia David Sergeenko, also reveal an ongoing Pentagon project on Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever in the country.Georgians used as laboratory rabbitsThe minister’s e-mails also reveal another American project on Hepatitis C in Georgia including cases of death. The pilot study of the US Center for Disease Control in Georgia is called “Simplified Diagnostics and Monitoring of Hepatitis C Infected Patients in Rural Primary Care Settings Using Newly Approved Pan-Genotypic Antiviral Therapy”. It is designated as confidential information. The Ministry of Health of Georgia has signed an Agreement with the US Center for Disease Control and the private American pharmaceutical company Gilead. According to this agreement, the American side provides free medicines for Hepatitis C treatment. In exchange, the private American company cannot be held accountable for any damage (intentional or not) which may result from the program. The agreement is signed by David Sergeenko from the Georgian side.From Paris with loveLeaked e-mails between minister Sergeenko and the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) which supports the program on Hepatitic C in Georgia reveal private meetings in Paris between the government officials and Gilead.Confidential reports: At least 100 death cases in GeorgiaLeaked confidential documents show at least 100 deaths reported to Gilead, over the last 3 years, of patients under treatment with the Gilead drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni which had been provided to them for free.Georgians have been used as laboratory rabbits for a new Hepatitis C experimental treatment by the private American company along with the US Center for Disease Control. Moreover, in some of the death cases reports sent to Gilead from the Georgian Ministry of Health the cause of death is indicated as unknown or not related to the treatment. 30 Georgians died during the drug clinical trials in December 2015 alone. Another 30 death cases were reported in April 2016, also in the span of only a month. It is worth noting that the drugs are neither emergency resuscitation drugs for patients in clinical death condition, nor cancer palliative drugs. Most causes of death remain obscure and some diagnoses do not correlate with the International Classification of Diseases by WHO.30 cases of death were reported in April 2016 alone. According to the reports, however, the cause of death was not linked to the treatment or was unknown.To make things worse, the US government agency has launched the ostensibly altruistic project on free medicines for the poor Georgian people in partnership with the private American company Gilead thus being in direct conflict of interest. A financial report for 2017 reveals that the same company Gilead is among the main sponsors of the Center for Disease Control Foundation.The biggest shareholder in Gilead is the former US Minister of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.On 5 September 2018, the Anticorruption Department of the Georgian National Security Agency announced that it had launched an investigation into the Hepatitis C program.The US-funded Lugar Center in Tbilisi may have been involved in illegal experiments on Georgian citizens, the country’s former security minister Igor Giorgadze has claimed, citing leaked documents he obtained. He said he managed to acquire over 100,000 pages of documents about the research done at the Richard Lugar Center.The minister of Health of Georgia David Sergeenko did not respond to my questions. The leaked e-mails though show the minister’s reaction.Coincidentally I was inexplicably locked up in the bedroom of my rented flat in Tbilisi while sleeping and was freed by Emergency services who accessed the locked room through the roof.How I was locked up in the bedroom of my rented flat in #Tbilisi while investigating a US military program including a pilot study with 100 death cases reports.

There are more babies than jihadis in Idlib. As it happens this gem of moral blackmail is untrue. There are twice as many jihadis (about 100,000) as babies (0-1 year) (55,000). What is this factoid meant to say anyway? Don’t try to free an area of jihadis because you might harm a lot of children? The Western coalition scarcely heeded that consideration in razing Mosul and Raqqa in order to crush ISIS. They are still pulling babies out of the rubble in Raqqa.2. The reports [of the imminent chemical weapons ‘attack’] must be true because Assad has done it before. False. Since 2013 when Assad gave up chemical weapons under supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) the OPCW have not visited the sites of alleged attacks in jihadi-controlled areas but have accepted at face value ‘reports’ from pro-jihadi organisations like the White Helmets and the Syrian American Medical Society, along with ‘evidence’ from hostile intelligence agencies. In the case of the one site the OPCW did visit, Douma, their report said they found no evidence of sarin, no untoward traces in any of the blood samples taken from ‘alleged victims’ (their term), no bodies and only ambiguous evidence of use of chlorine.3. The OPCW report on Douma was flawed because the Russians and Syrians caused delay. False. As documented in the OPCW report, delay was caused by UN bureaucracy and jihadi snipers. The inspectors do not say their findings were to any significant degree invalidated by the delay.4. Assad uses chemical weapons because they frighten large numbers of people into fleeing. False. They don’t. This desperate argument is trotted out to counter the fact that Assad would have to be stupid to use chemical weapons knowing what the result would be and that he would derive minimal military benefit. To date, not one of the alleged chemical attacks has precipitated an exodus any greater than flight caused by the legendary ‘barrel bombs’. The inhabitants of Douma by their own testimonies given to Western journalists were even unaware there might have been an attack until they heard about it in the media.5. The OPCW won’t be able to investigate because it won’t be safe. A feeble excuse to preempt calls for establishing facts before bombing. The Turks escort Western journalists into Idlib. They have hundreds of troops there and the jihadis kowtow to them because they control all logistics. The Turks could escort OPCW. And wouldn’t the jihadis be keener than anybody for the inspectors to visit if their claims were true?6. The upcoming strikes are not aimed at regime change. False. The plan is to decapitate the Syrian state with attacks on the presidency. Failing that the aim is to make Idlib a quagmire for the Russians. Anything to deprive Asad and Putin of victory, regardless of whether it prolongs the war.7. It’s all Russian disinformation. Yeah, like the arms inspectors before the Iraq war who said no WMD in Iraq. Reality: the Russians have got great intelligence on what Western powers with their jihadi clients are up to and are calling out the phoney moves.8. There won’t be enough time for parliamentary debate. Pull the other one. Reality: the government are terrified of a rerun of 2013 when Labour and 30 brave Tory MPs voted against bombing, causing Cameron and then Obama to back off.9. MPs can’t be told what is planned because it would jeopardise the safety of service personnel. How low can you stoop? Feigning concern for flyers when it’s really just about keeping the people in ignorance of how big the strikes are going to be.10. There are going to be massacres, a bloodbath, or ‘genocide’. False. We heard all this hysteria before Aleppo, before Eastern Ghouta and before the campaign in the South. All vastly exaggerated. The Syrian Arab Army has not been responsible for a single massacre, while the jihadis have been responsible for many (source: quarterly reports of the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria).11. People have nowhere to go. False. The Russians have opened safe corridors but the jihadis are not allowing people to leave. They can still leave for the northern border strip which Turkey controls, where there are camps, and many (including jihadi fighters) will be able to cross temporarily into Turkey.12. We can’t tell you which armed groups we support because it would make them targets for Assad. Really? You think he doesn’t know? Isn’t it because you are terrified it will come out that we have been supporting some real head-choppers?***Author Peter Ford is a retired British Diplomat who was Ambassador to Bahrain from 1999-2003 and Syria from 2003-2006.SEE ALSO: A Brief Guide to Western Media Propaganda For SyriaREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_7318-e1536949111585.jpg8bef957c9701497c9fbced1dcaa01053	[]	2018-09-14 00:00:00	The Bluffer’s Guide to Bombing Syria	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	The Bluffer’s Guide to Bombing Syria	0	"ByPeter Ford, former British Ambassador to Syria, with a rather useful media guide, aptly described as, “The Dirty Dozen: 12 lies they tell you to anaesthetise you for the upcoming bombing of Syria.”IMAGE: Jingoist war propaganda image courtesy of the UK Mirror newspaper.Peter Ford21st Century WireThe propaganda mills of the British and American governments – spokespersons, media, think tanks – are working overtime churning out ‘talking points’ to justify the upcoming large scale bombing of Syria on the pretext of use of prohibited weapons.Here is a guide from a former insider to the top dozen of these lies.1.

False. We heard all this hysteria before Aleppo, before Eastern Ghouta and before the campaign in the South. All vastly exaggerated. The Syrian Arab Army has not been responsible for a single massacre, while the jihadis have been responsible for many (source: quarterly reports of the UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria).11. People have nowhere to go. False. The Russians have opened safe corridors but the jihadis are not allowing people to leave. They can still leave for the northern border strip which Turkey controls, where there are camps, and many (including jihadi fighters) will be able to cross temporarily into Turkey.12. We can’t tell you which armed groups we support because it would make them targets for Assad. Really? You think he doesn’t know? Isn’t it because you are terrified it will come out that we have been supporting some real head-choppers?***Author Peter Ford is a retired British Diplomat who was Ambassador to Bahrain from 1999-2003 and Syria from 2003-2006.SEE ALSO: A Brief Guide to Western Media Propaganda For SyriaREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_7318-e1536949111585.jpg9d70d79a9d5f431c8e879ad852e60e94	[]	2018-09-26 00:00:00	Liberty Report: ‘The Good, Bad, & The Ugly’ of Trump’s UN Speech	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Liberty Report: ‘The Good, Bad, & The Ugly’ of Trump’s UN Speech	0	"By21st Century Wire says…There wasn’t much ‘good’ at all in President Trump’s speech Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, prompting the question ‘what were the speech writers smoking?’ when they wrote it:Seriously @realDonaldTrump, that #TrumpUNSpeech was the most pathetic, limp-wristed, nonsensical pile of steaming cow patties in history of the #UN.

At the official opening of the park, he declared, “Eastern Turkestan is not only the home of the Turkic peoples but also the cradle of Turkic history, civilization and culture. To forget that would lead to the ignorance of our own history, civilization and culture. The martyrs of Eastern Turkestan are our martyrs”.These people are known by the name Uyghur, and they live in the far Western province of Xinjiang, China. They are Chinese citizens, but from an ethnic minority. In 2009 deadly violence erupted there; however, the Chinese authorities had mentioned earlier in 2002, that a radical Islamic terrorist group, which was supported by foreign sources and under the umbrella of al Qaeda, had been carrying out terrorist attacks in China.Who are these terrorists and how did they manage to form a base of operations in Idlib, Syria?Terror’s ‘Silk Road’The East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) operates as the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP), which is also known as “Katibat Turkistani.” Osama Bin Laden pledged his support for the group during a 1999 meeting in Afghanistan. Its members have trained with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The US Department of State labeled ETIM as a foreign terrorist organization. On July 28, 2016, TIP became an official faction of Jabhat Al Nusra, which is an al-Qaeda organisation in Syria.Addition to Turkey’s own role since 2011 in facilitating the build-up of militant armies in southern Turkey, President Erdogan of firmly backed the US covert operations during the terrorist attacks on Syria, beginning in 2011. Turkey officially became the transit point of all international terrorists with a final destination of Syria. Recent scandal reveal the sophistication of the organized smuggling rings being run in and out if Syria via Turkey. The Turkish airlines and airports were full of passengers going on Jihad. The Turkish businesses were making money hand-over-fist on everything from taxis, hotel rooms, and food; all the way to organ transplants, which were the by-product of the unwilling Syrian donors who were slaughtered.Another plan was formulated by the Turkish authorities, saw the issuance of Turkish passports to scores of Uyghurs, where they would leave China on international flights, with their destination being Istanbul, Turkey. Along the journey, some Uyghur were held for questioning in Indonesia, and elsewhere. The authorities there were suspicious of their Turkish passports, being held by persons who looked Chinese. When confronted, they insisted they were Turkish citizens traveling as tourists in Asia. The Indonesian officials summoned the Turkish Embassy, and they surprisingly confirmed they were Turkish. The Turkish immigration clerks at the airport were trained to identify these special passports, and confiscate them. Thus, once in, the Uyghurs would not be able to leave Turkey, guaranteeing they would be stuck in Idlib, Syria on jihad duty whilst indirectly under the control of the Turkish government.Brothers-in-Arms: Uyghurs pictured among some of the worst terrorists in Syria (Image Source: Sindo News)Turkey’s ‘Second Islamic State’ in IdlibBased on the process of events, it would appear that Erdogan’s plan depended on altering Syrian demographics; by repopulating Idlib province with jihadist Chinese Uyghurs, who attacked Syrian homeowners and farmers, causing them to flee and thus abandoning their properties to the foreigners. The Turkish President has a vision of a new Turcic colony annexed to Turkey.Much has been written about President Erdogan’s mercenary army of Uyghurs, who have been in Idlib for years. The Uyghur mentality does not fit the stereotype of their fellow ISIS and Al Qaeda brothers-in-arms. The Uyghurs insist on living in their traditional family order. They didn’t invade Syria alone: they came with wives, children and parents. Full multi-generational families are living in the rural Idlib countryside. They established schools for their children, who are taught in the Turcic language, which is the original root of the modern Turkish language. They occupied homes and farms which are owned by Syrian families who were made homeless by these Chinese Jihadis.Zanbaqi is a village located near Jisr al-Shughur, just out of Idlib. The tiny hamlet’s residents numbered just 752 in the Syrian national census taken in 2004. However, today there are about 3,500 Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) militants and their families living there, with their military camps training hundreds of children from these families. TIP trains not only Uighur children, but local children to be “little jihadists.” Zanbaqi now looks more like China than Damascus. Katibat al Ghuraba, or Katibat al Ghuraba al Turkistan (KGT) came to light in July 2017, when their YouTube videos of combat, weapons use, and a training camp/ school for children were uploaded.Sadly, there are many reports of foreign terrorists, including Uzbek and Uyghurs grooming children for the next generation of jihad:To the people of #Idlib If these international terrorists don't care about their own children, and brought them to die in a warzone Then what makes you think they care about your children? Time to kick them out! pic.twitter.com/VHmiNnzWj3 — The'Nimr'Tiger 🇸🇾🇸🇨 (@Souria4Syrians) September 10, 2018Syria’s ambassador in Beijing, Imad Moustapha, declared up to 5,000 ethnic Uyghurs from China were in Syria fighting alongside armed jihadists as of May 2017. For anyone who has actually followed real reporting on the ground in Syria, you would know that Uyghurs are among the most violent of all the various fighting groups in Syria. The mere fact that they are alongside Jabhat al Nusra is telling, as they are considered to be the most feared terrorists in the field. On June 10, 2015 the Qalb Loze massacre was carried out as the Uyghurs participated hand-in-hand with their brothers-in-arms, slaughtering civilians. Churches and the Christian communities of Idlib region were not spared. Christians are a minority there, and the Uyghurs and their cohorts preyed upon these communities. They forced them out of their properties and damaged churches. Priests were beheaded and kidnapped.At the 6th round of Astana Talks, for the purpose of a political solution to the Syrian conflict, the 3 participating countries, Russia, Iran and Turkey, agreed to a de-escalation zone including Idlib, in September 2017. However, the ISIS and Al Qaeda affiliated terrorists groups were never included. The UN resolution 2254 clearly states all UN member states must fight terrorist groups, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, Jibhat al Nusra and other radical armed jihadists. Because Idlib has been home to thousands of foreign jihadists, as well as the very small community of Free Syrian Army (FSA), who the UN, USA, and NATO call “moderate rebels”; the “War on Terror” began by President George W. Bush was held in limbo. The Russian, Syrian and Iranian position was to follow international law, and the letter of the UN 2254, which makes it clear that fighting the ISIS and Al Qaeda, and their affiliates, is the only way forward, in the path to restoring peace and security to Idlib.Earlier this month, Russia’s special envoy on Syria Alexander Lavrentiev told reporters after talks in Geneva with UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, that it is up to Turkey to separate Islamist militants from the moderate opposition in Idlib. As it stands now, Russia and Turkey have negotiated a peaceful impasse which, if it holds, may avert what would certainly be a bloody affair in the final battle.The other half of the story in Idlib is missing in mainstream media. Where is the story of millions of civilian hostages and human shields who have suffered in Idlib since the terrorist occupation in began in 2013? What about the men prevented from leaving, where residents were threatened with death if they didn’t stay to defend Idlib from the final battle? Note how as the last battle in Idlib was approaching, civilians report the terrorists were not allowing them to leave. What about the women used as slaves by the terrorists and foreign interlopers? What about the children prevented from accessing normal education and forced into servitude by the terrorists? Those stories will eventually be told the survivors. Either way, the real untold stories of Idlib will come out – much to the chagrin of propaganda outlets like CNN and others who have taken it upon themselves to be the PR adjuncts of al Qaeda in Idlib.We currently see Uyghurs living abroad in USA being interviewed on mainstream western media. They are adept at getting their message to Western audiences, who are sympathetic to the plight of the under-dog, and the ‘freedom fighter’ stance so dear to American revolutionary cultural mythos. This was followed by the proverbial Uyghur wave which swept across the Western and Gulf media, with well-known mainstream commentators all chiming-in (at the same time) with words of solidarity for the Uyghurs in China, and not surprisingly, none of them will mentioned the violent Western and Gulf-backed terrorist army encamped in Idlib:One million Muslim Uighurs may have been detained by the Chinese government – where’s the global outrage?

Eurasia will be the battle ground, and disrupting the Belt and Road project seems to be the raison d’etre of that effort. Westerners need to ask themselves if they would like armed terrorists living next door to them (or with them, in the case of Syria), but if they terrorize people in Syria or China that is alright as far as the western mainstream polity is concerned. In that inverted reality, the terrorist becomes the victim under the mainstream media.On August 1, 2018, the Chinese Ambassador to Damascus, Qi Qianjin, said that the Chinese military would be willing to participate in the battle in Idlib, while expressing regret that Chinese Uyghurs were involved as terrorists. Bearing all this in mind, no should really be surprised then that China and Russia joined-up to stage the largest military exercise in those two country’s history:China participating in giant Russian military exercise. Tells you all you need to know about the ham-fisted ineptitude of recent Western diplomacy. Far from isolating Russia, it has drawn much closer to the next dominant superpower. — Craig Murray (@CraigMurrayOrg) September 11, 2018When it’s all said and done, history may look back at Syria as another Western regime change debacle. But even if that’s true, as with Afghanistan and Kosovo, their Mujahideen will simply be re-deployed to a new theater.Then the real question is: will Operation Cyclone ever end?***21WIRE Special Contributor Steven Sahiounie is an American citizen born in Fresno, California.

Rosenstein testified that Mueller was running his office “appropriately” and without bias, prompting one committee member to suggest Mueller’s team should be attired with ’Democratic donkey jerseys’ and ‘I’m with Hillary t-shirts’.And just this past week, a New York Times report claimed Rosenstein “suggested last year that he secretly record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration, and he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office for being unfit.”Not surprisingly, the ‘Russiagate’-aligned media, to include CNN, has been thrown into a frenzy of speculation, with one top Democrat calling the situation a “slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre.”Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), a longtime Russiagate provocateur on the cable news network, also weighed in on cue, touting the “independence of the DOJ”:Under no circumstances should Rod Rosenstein resign. This would place the Mueller investigation in even greater jeopardy. Rosenstein should continue to do his job, protect the independence of the DOJ, and if the President intends to obstruct justice, force Trump to fire him. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2018Rosenstein disputes the claims made in the NYT report:“The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect, […] I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda.”Trump plans to meet with Rosenstein on Thursday, undoubtedly to decide his fate at the DOJ.READ MORE RUSSIAGATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire RussiaGate FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Thirteen_Russian_RR_DOJ-e1537850676838.jpg1ac91560bb4f4b0d855b5b3fa8956554	['Jay Dyer']	2018-09-24 00:00:00	Lil Peep, David Lynch, Twin Peaks & Metaphysics	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Lil Peep, David Lynch, Twin Peaks & Metaphysics	0	"ByJay Dyer21st Century WireWicca Phase Springs Eternal has garnered tens of millions of views on YouTube in the last few years and after his collaborations and major hits with the now deceased Lil’ Peep, has exploded in popularity.

Iranian researcher Dr. Mohamed Sadiq al-Husseini wrote that according to Iranian intelligence sources revealed that the terrorist attack of Ahvaz city was conducted in coordination between the “People’s Mojahedin Organization” of Iran or the “Mojahedin-e Khalq” [MEK] and the “Ahwazia” an Arab-Iranian separatist group with alleged connections to Saudi Arabia, also known as the “Ahvaz National Resistance”.It’s no secret the U.S. national security establishment and its neocon conclave have anointed this shady terrorist organization, the notorious MEK, to assume the reigns of power in Iran in the event of a regime change.President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, openly talks about Iran regime change every chance he gets.“It could be in a few days, months, a couple of years. But it’s going to happen,” Giuliani said at the “Iran Uprising Summit” event in New York on Saturday.Since the Ahvaz terror attack, which killed 25 people, the Iranian government has vowed ‘revenge’ against the U.S. and its allies who support MEK, an organization that in 2012 was delisted from the U.S. State Department’s designated terror list by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Read more about this story from Marwa Osman at AlahedNews…READ MORE IRAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iran FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRAN-PARADE-AHVAZ-e1537631747915.pngf1d8c81ced7f4134ad71e01bb26ea74c	[]	2018-09-23 00:00:00	Sunday Wire Redux: ‘Operation Paper Bag’ with guests Mike Robinson, Vanessa Beeley	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Sunday Wire Redux: ‘Operation Paper Bag’ with guests Mike Robinson, Vanessa Beeley	0	"ByLISTEN TO THE SUNDAY WIRE LIVE EVERY SUNDAY:5pm-8pm UK Time | 12pm-3pm ET (US) | 9am-12am PT (US)The SUNDAY WIRE will not broadcast live this week – so we’re running a repeat of Episode #242 ‘Operation Paper Bag’ hosted by Patrick Henningsen with guests Mike Robinson and Vanessa Beeley.In the first hour, we’ll discuss all the latest from #Russiagate and the Trump-Putin Summit fall-out in the hysterical US and UK media, the betrayal and unknown fate of Julian Assange who is set to be handed over to U.K. authorities this week, as well as the horrific Return of Tony Blair to the airwaves threatening to break back into politics, and more.In the second hour, we’ll connect with special guest Vanessa Beeley for an update on “Operation Paper Bag” (because you may need one after you hear this story), with news that Israel has “evacuated” 800 White Helmets/Jihadis and their families from Syria heading for debriefing by their Intelligence services handlers and with any luck – a new life with their western and NATO sponsors in Europe, Canada and the US.In the final hour, we’ll connect with the SUNDAY WIRE roving correspondent for Culture & Sport, Basil Valentine, for the latest coup de grâce in UK and US politics.Enjoy the show and see you all next week right here on ACR’s live global stream…HELP US KEEP DOING WHAT WE DO: DONATE TO 21WIREOR SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TVDownload Episode #242Sunday Wire Radio Show Archives"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1-White-Helmets-Terrorists.jpgb126397cc3754cacb77789d6c3a9e75c	[]	2018-09-22 00:00:00	Syrian Arab Army Restarts Operation to Erase ISIS from Homs	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Syrian Arab Army Restarts Operation to Erase ISIS from Homs	0	"ByAl Masdar News reports…BEIRUT, LEBANON (6:10 P.M.) – The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) restarted their operation in the eastern countryside of the Homs Governorate after a fierce battle with the Islamic State (ISIS) the week prior.Led by their Republican Guard forces, the Syrian Arab Army restarted their operation this week by targeting a number of areas belonging to the Islamic State terrorists in the Badiya Al-Sham region of east Homs.According to Anna News, the Syrian Arab Army has been clearing several Islamic State hideouts and trenches that have been used to launch attacks against the government forces in the past.As shown in the video below, the Syrian Arab Army has been engaged in a fierce battle with the last remaining Islamic State terrorists that are still active at this front in the eastern countryside of the Homs Governorate:READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SAA-ISIS-TRENCH-HOMS-e1537640542295.png41863da6f7994d4d9783b08c84eb35da	['Jay Dyer']	2018-08-19 00:00:00	Episode #246 – ‘Silicon Valley Dystopian Madness’ with Jay Dyer and Patrick Henningsen	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Episode #246 – ‘Silicon Valley Dystopian Madness’ with Jay Dyer and Patrick Henningsen	0		https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1-SUNDAY-WIRE-RADIO-SHOW.jpg457438c713314c55adc9414dd6b166b2	[]	2018-08-09 00:00:00	US Senate Calls Julian Assange to Testify as Russiagate ‘Hinges on Conspiracy’	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	US Senate Calls Julian Assange to Testify as Russiagate ‘Hinges on Conspiracy’	0	"ByThe US Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday requested that WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange testify on Russian ‘meddling’ in the 2016 election.The ‘mutually agreed upon time and location’ also comes with the strict condition from Assange’s legal team that “testimony must conform to a high ethical standard,” according to this Wikileaks tweet:BREAKING: US Senate Intelligence Committee calls editor @JulianAssange to testify.

On top of that, some politically active users who defy Mainstream Media dogma have alleged that they’re being “shadow blocked”, meaning that the algorithm is suppressing their account’s so-called “organic reach”, or sometimes outright censored through frivolous blocking.”For burgeoning technocrats, it seems that the Establishment’s contrived ‘fake news crisis‘ is the gift that just keeps on giving. As Facebook moves into its latest Orwellian phase of political censorship, critics are beginning to ask what will become of the Silicon Valley’s most famous digital monopoly. Has Facebook sold out its user base? Will intelligent and influential content producers and consumers now begin migrating in greater numbers to more Constitutional or free speech-friendly social media platforms? Sputnik Radio’s cutting edge program Trend Storm explores this question with special guests, 21WIRE’s Patrick Henningsen and Joaquin Flores, Editor-in-Chief of Fort Russ News.Trend Storm host Andrew Korybko writes: “From being indirectly implicated in the Russiagate conspiracy for supposedly allowing fake news to be peddled on its platform to being exposed earlier this year for allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest its users’ data for political purposes, it’s fair to say that Facebook has been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons over the past couple of years.

If the British then hand over Assange to the US, he will face an uncertain fate which could range from a military tribunal, to federal imprisonment, or even the death penalty for the high crimes of espionage and treason.Moreno was not shy about his own bias in the case saying, “I’ve never agreed with the activity Mr. Assange performs, I’ve never agreed with the intervention in people’s emails to obtain information despite how valuable it is to shed light on some undesirable acts by governments and people… There are correct and legal ways to it.”21WIRE’s Patrick Henningsen spoke to RT International about these recent developments and the potentially dangerous legal precedents which could be set by both the UK and US governments.

So we really need to step back and look for more, and as some of the representatives in UN Security Council were saying yesterday we need to really have more evidence before this claim can be stood up if there is the evidence to support the fact that is was certainly GRU.”Robinson also addressed the ‘dangerous politicization’ some British diplomats may use in an attempt to conflate the Skripal affair and the situation in Syria:“We also need to be very aware that this might become politicized and used as part of accusations and claims being made in the context Syria.

Here’s a recap of the event from Strategic Culture…Peter KorzunStrategic CultureRussian President Vladimir Putin has wound up his European trip to include the Austrian FM’s wedding ceremony and talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The drop-in visit to Austria showed that Putin enjoys good personal relations with the representatives of Europe’s political beau monde. They see nothing odd in inviting him to social events, such as the wedding of Austrian FM Karin Kneissl, especially if the organizers want to grab the media spotlight.This was followed by a summit with the German chancellor — the second time the two leaders have met in just over three months. The previous meeting took place in the Black Sea city of Sochi in May. The chancellor has visited Russia several times.The “Meseberg Castle talks” in Germany were substantive and detailed, as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has noted, but evidently important enough that few details were made public. For some time the leaders talked tête-à-tête without interpreters. They compared notes on Ukraine (including the prospects for a UN-sponsored peace mission and the EU’s new role of mediator), Syria (and the problems of its reconstruction), the US sanctions on Iran, and the future of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas-pipeline project.There were no agreements planned for the meeting, but the “America First” policy is pushing these two countries that are divided by their different views on international issues toward a closer cooperation. Russia can play a very important role in creating the right conditions under which the Syrian refugees could leave Germany and return home, thus mitigating that pressing problem. Syria’s reconstruction is opening up new opportunities for Russian-German cooperation.President Putin and Chancellor Merkel discussed the idea of a meeting on Syria involving the leaders of France and Turkey as well as Russia and Germany. They agreed to launch new talks under this format. No date for that four-nation summit was set.Some time ago, such a visit to Germany and Austria was hardly conceivable and any hope of reviving a dialog would have seemed far-fetched. The times are changing, reflecting the need to get that relationship back to normal. Conflicts and negative emotions are giving way to cool-headed, constructive approaches. Besides, Russia has demonstrated its ability to resist pressure.Right on the eve of the Putin-Merkel summit, the Wall Street Journal published an article about the sanctions being prepared by the US to stop Nord Stream 2. It’s time for Germany to stand tall and continue to pursue that project. During the talks with President Putin, Chancellor Merkel said that’s exactly what she is going to do. A cursory look at history supports her position.In the early 1980s the administration of US President Ronald Reagan was trying to prevent Western Europe and the Soviet Union from working together over energy. Sanctions were used as an instrument to force them into submission. Despite that, the “Brotherhood” pipeline (Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod), also dubbed the Siberian pipeline or the Yamal project, was born in the heat of the Cold War. The framework agreement between West Germany and the USSR was signed in July 1981. Chancellor Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik policy was continued, to everyone’s benefit. In November 1982, the sanctions were lifted, and on January 1, 1984, natural gas started to flow. The similarity between Yamal and Nord Stream 2 is obvious. Resisting pressure benefits the one who refuses to kneel.Germany is not alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is a strong supporter of Nord Stream 2. The Republic of Austria became the first country in Western Europe to sign a gas contract with the Soviet Union in 1968. In 2017, a new record for Russian gas exports to Austria was set at 9.1 billion cubic meters, an increase of 50.3% (3 billion cubic meters) from 2016 (6.1 billion cubic meters) and 33.8% (2.3 billion cubic meters) from 2005, when the previous record had been reached (6.8 billion cubic meters).Donald Trump is very critical of the German chancellor, whose government is not as strong as it used to be. The idea to withdraw American forces from Germany has recently been floated. The ongoing rift between the US and its European NATO allies opens up the question of the continent’s security.Before the July NATO summit, the chancellor came out in support of President Macron’s initiative to create a European expeditionary force. It was Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the current German president and then foreign minister, who launched a European arms–control initiative in 2016. And it was West Germany who signed the Treaty of Moscow with the USSR in August, 1970 which contributed to détente. During the meeting with Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel emphasized that disagreements with Moscow must be resolved through dialog. She feels that there are many conflicts that can be settled if the two nations cooperate.Indeed, Russia and Germany historically have had a special relationship. They began cooperating economically and working to ease political tensions against the backdrop of confrontation between the West and East. They can do so again. The Meseberg meeting showed that both sides realize the importance of dialog and the need to avoid at all costs any return to the Cold War.***READ MORE INTERNATIONAL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire International FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/or-41267-e1534800614747.jpg66feb2a9f4004c7e8569fb560ee263bb	[]	2018-07-31 00:00:00	UK COLUMN: Facebook’s Censorship Machine, NYT Propaganda, MH370 and more	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	UK COLUMN: Facebook’s Censorship Machine, NYT Propaganda, MH370 and more	0	"ByThis week we learn that government continues to double-down on its own paranoia of the public finding out the real scale of its corruption and collusion with dirty corporations, international terrorists and more.

To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a US peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise,” the Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said in the official statement.Here is the official response by the head of the PLO General Delegation, Ambassador Dr. Husam Zomlot:We condemn in the strongest terms, the US administration’s decision to close the Palestinian mission to the US. However, we are not surprised.Such a reckless act confirms that the administration is blindly executing Israel’s “wish list,” which starts with shutting down Palestinian diplomatic representation in the US.The administration’s reasoning for such an act is the refusal of the Palestinian leadership and the PLO Delegation to the US to cooperate with the so-called “peace efforts” and our actions to hold Israel accountable by referring it to the International Criminal Court. We stand firm in our decision not to cooperate in this ongoing campaign to liquidate our rights and cause. Our rights are not for sale and we will block any attempts at bullying and blackmailing us to forgo our legitimate and internationally endorsed rights.Those who have pushed for such an act are taking a direct aim not only against the Palestinian people and the historic US-Palestinian relationship, but also the prospects for peace in the Middle East and the integrity of the international political and legal system.The US administration is committing to protect Israel from unlawful acts, and provide it with full immunity to kill the two state-solution, and continue violating basic human and national rights of the people of Palestine, while attacking and undermining the international system of legitimacy and legality.However, this confirms for us that we are on the right track. We will step up our efforts to hold Israel accountable under international law, continue building international alliances for peace, double our efforts to reach out to the American people as we witness the transformational change in American public opinion in support of the Palestinian cause and our legitimate rights.While today is a dark day for peace in the Middle East, for multilateralism, and the integrity of the international political and legal system, we will continue our struggle to pursue all possible legal and political means to achieve peace, independence, and our internationally enshrined rights."	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PLO-DC-e1536617346938.jpgb35526e548a84c98800c1536d71d2751	[]	2018-09-10 00:00:00	Veteran Intelligence Professionals to Trump: ‘Moscow Has Upped the Ante in Syria, Big Difference This Time’	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Veteran Intelligence Professionals to Trump: ‘Moscow Has Upped the Ante in Syria, Big Difference This Time’	0	"ByVeteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) collectively penned an open letter to U.S. President Donald Trump admonishing him to speak now and with authority for Russia and the world to hear – telling the jihadists embedded in Syria that “theirs is a lost cause.”In the VIPS letter, a range of issues are addressed including the dangerous prospect of “direct Russian-U.S. hostilities” and the unclear nature of U.S. leadership on Syria policy, in particular the role of John Bolton.The full letter is included below and was originally published to Consortium News:As Syrian forces backed by Russia launch the final showdown in Syria against jihadist extremists in Idlib province, the potential for a U.S.-Russia confrontation has never been greater, as VIPS warns in this memo to the president.

The Syrians will almost certainly succeed, as they did in late 2016 in Aleppo. As in Aleppo, it will mean unspeakable carnage, unless someone finally tells the insurgents theirs is a lost cause.That someone is you. The Israelis, Saudis, and others who want unrest to endure are egging on the insurgents, assuring them that you, Mr. President, will use US forces to protect the insurgents in Idlib, and perhaps also rain hell down on Damascus. We believe that your senior advisers are encouraging the insurgents to think in those terms, and that your most senior aides are taking credit for your recent policy shift from troop withdrawal from Syria to indefinite war.Big Difference This TimeRussian missile-armed naval and air units are now deployed in unprecedented numbers to engage those tempted to interfere with Syrian and Russian forces trying to clean out the terrorists from Idlib. We assume you have been briefed on that — at least to some extent. More important, we know that your advisers tend to be dangerously dismissive of Russian capabilities and intentions.We do not want you to be surprised when the Russians start firing their missiles. The prospect of direct Russian-U.S. hostilities in Syria is at an all-time high. We are not sure you realize that.The situation is even more volatile because Kremlin leaders are not sure who is calling the shots in Washington. This is not the first time that President Putin has encountered such uncertainty (see brief Appendix below). This is, however, the first time that Russian forces have deployed in such numbers into the area, ready to do battle. The stakes are very high.We hope that John Bolton has given you an accurate description of his acerbic talks with his Russian counterpart in Geneva a few weeks ago. In our view, it is a safe bet that the Kremlin is uncertain whether Bolton faithfully speaks in your stead, or speaks INSTEAD of you.The best way to assure Mr. Putin that you are in control of U.S. policy toward Syria would be for you to seek an early opportunity to speak out publicly, spelling out your intentions. If you wish wider war, Bolton has put you on the right path.If you wish to cool things down, you may wish to consider what might be called a pre-emptive ceasefire. By that we mean a public commitment by the Presidents of the U.S. and Russia to strengthen procedures to preclude an open clash between U.S. and Russian armed forces. We believe that, in present circumstances, this kind of extraordinary step is now required to head off wider war.For the VIPS Steering Group, signed:William Binney, former Technical Director, World Geopolitical & Military Analysis, NSA; co-founder, SIGINT Automation Research Center (ret.)Marshall Carter-Tripp, Foreign Service Officer (ret.) and Division Director, State Department Bureau of Intelligence and ResearchPhilip Giraldi, CIA Operations Officer (retired)James George Jatras, former U.S. diplomat and former foreign policy adviser to Senate Republican leadership (Associate VIPS)Michael S.

(In public remarks bordering on the insubordinate, senior Pentagon officials a few days earlier had showed unusually open skepticism regarding key aspects of the Kerry-Lavrov agreement – like sharing intelligence with the Russians (a key provision of the deal approved by both Obama and Putin). Here’s what Lavrov said on Sept 26:“My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the US military machine. Despite the fact that, as always, [they] made assurances that the US Commander in Chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin), apparently the military does not really listen to the Commander in Chief.”Lavrov went beyond mere rhetoric. He also specifically criticized JCS Chairman Joseph Dunford for telling Congress that he opposed sharing intelligence with Russia, “after the agreements concluded on direct orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Barack Obama stipulated that they would share intelligence. … It is difficult to work with such partners. …”Oct 27, 2016: Putin speaks at the Valdai International Discussion ClubAt Valdai Russian President Putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented: “My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.” He complained about “people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.”Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) is made up of former intelligence officers, diplomats, military officers and congressional staffers. The organization, founded in 2002, was among the first critics of Washington’s justifications for launching a war against Iraq. VIPS advocates a US foreign and national security policy based on genuine national interests rather than contrived threats promoted for largely political reasons.

The Netherlands, U.K., France, Canada and Germany are scrambling to find a way to save the lives of an estimated 1,000 volunteers and their family members. Around 300 of them are considered to be in imminent danger.”The UK are primary creators and fundraisers for the Al Qaeda (and splinter groups) auxiliary and Theresa May was quick to leap to their defence:“Prime Minister Theresa May personally brought up the emergency issue during her meeting with Mr. Trump in the U.K. Formally known as the Syrian Civil Defense group, the White Helmets expect to be marked as resistance targets and slaughtered by Assad’s forces, which are backed by Iranian and Russian firepower.”This is not the first time that the White Helmets have been given such high level protection by the members of the “International Community” who have been waging an illegal war against Syria for more than seven years. On the 16th March 2018, the permanent Syrian representative at the UN, Dr Bashar Al Jaafari informed the UN Security Council:“He warned that giving the opportunity for terrorist groups, including the so-called “White Helmets” which are affiliated to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, to use the Security Council as a podium constitutes a flagrant violation of UNSC resolutions, particularly those related to combating terrorism, adding “the biggest scandal is that a UN agency operating in Damascus demanded the evacuation of 76 members of White Helmets from Eastern Ghouta, while paying no attention to the lives of thousands of civilians.”On the 17th March, NATO-aligned, Soros funded NGO – Human Rights Watch reported:“On March 17, Human Rights Watch received a distress call from a member of the Syrian Civil Defense who told Human Rights Watch that he and 19 colleagues, five of whom are wounded, have been surrounded by government forces. According to him, in addition, there are 90 members of the Syrian Civil Defense and their relatives trapped in a second location, and they are all requesting safe passage to non-government-held areas. He said they fear retaliation, including summary execution, when the government takes the area.”It appears that NATO member states have brought pressure to bear upon Trump prior to his meeting with Putin next week in the hope that Trump can persuade Putin to spare the lives of their most valuable asset, the White Helmets – who have been single-handedly responsible for producing and nurturing the majority of chemical/chlorine weapon attack narratives, including Khan Sheikhoun and Douma that has now been proven highly contentious by the OPCW interim report.21st Century Wire article: False Flag Fail: How Syrian Civilians Derailed White Helmet Chemical Stunt in Eastern GhoutaThe alarmist reports from the financiers of the White Helmets among NATO member states, include claims that the Syrian government will execute the members of this terrorist aligned group when liberation of the southern region is completed. These claims ignore the fact that, in East Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta, the White Helmets fled alongside the armed groups on the green buses that evacuated them to Idlib.“This effort says we are in the evacuation phase. It is an admission that the regime is going to regain control of the country and the White Helmets can’t remain,” said a U.S. government official.” ~ from CBS report.Trump has signalled the withdrawl of US presence inside Syria and an end to the illegal US occupation of the North East of Syria. The requested removal of the White Helmets is another admission of this group being a member of the regime-change-coalition apparatus as had been previously stated by US State Department spokesperson, Heather Nauert in an extraordinary press briefing:…As with East Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta liberations from extremist armed group occupation – these NATO member states and their lock-step media will not mention the scenes of celebration that are emerging from Daraa and the surrounding countryside following full liberation by the Syrian Arab Army and allies, including the Russian Amnesty and Reconciliation teams who will have negotiated the evacuations of the armed groups and their sidekicks, the White Helmets:What western media won't show you: 13 July 2018Demonstrations in Daraa, in support of the Syrian Army and government #Syriahttps://t.co/Md8s0xVULc pic.twitter.com/k1GoYmfNNQ — the Lemniscat (@theLemniscat) July 14, 2018No further proof is needed that the White Helmets are an integral part of the US Coalition regime change machinery and that deals have been struck to protect this primary propaganda construct that has consistently advocated “no fly zones” and called upon the international community to intervene militarily on behalf of the faux-revolutionary forces that have brutalised the Syrian people for more than seven years. Perhaps Trump genuinely intends to withdraw all assets from inside Syria – if that is the case where will the White Helmets go? Will they morph into a “security force” to “rebuild Syria” as has been suggested in a number of reports?White Helmets Exit strategy – resettlement into Europe https://t.co/YCIpjHw1Z5 — Friedemann Wo (@FriedemannWo) July 15, 2018The White Helmets do not stay to help the civilians, while claiming to have rescued 115,000 since their establishment in Turkey and Jordan in 2013. They move with the armed groups with no regard for the civilian population they leave behind.Much is made of the alleged Russian “propaganda campaign” to discredit this UK/US hybrid-war group of narrative builders but very little has been said about an informed Syrian population who understand the part played by this group in maintaining the war and the suffering of millions inside and outside Syria. It is Syria that will reject the White Helmets and it is Syrians who should be heard when they accuse this pseudo first response outfit of war crimes and child abduction, among a number of other atrocities they are accused of having committed or enabled:“Eastern Ghouta Testimonies April 2018, Damascus.“Civil defence” (White Helmets) were supposed to help wounded civilians, but NO! if any of the terrorists were wounded they would run to their aid, but civilians – NO. It was very rare, if they (White Helmets) weren’t going to film it, they wouldn’t come.When the camera was there they would run around as if they were helping people.Our neighbor in Zamalka – we left on Friday, but on the Previous Wednesday, there were strikes. The ceiling collapsed onto the woman, and her children. We – the women – pulled 3 kids from under the wreckage, they were alive, but the mother remained there, from the morning till the evening. Nobody came to help. We witnessed that. Her husband kept running around asking them for help, they said “NO”.They (White Helmets) blamed us for leaving the basement. We were dying in these basements. The smell, alone, could kill you. We were sitting on the floor, nothing there, not even toilets, we needed water, they had given us water tanks with taps, but when the taps were broken, they didn’t fix them. We had to go far away to find water.When the woman was trapped under the ceiling, they (White Helmets) didn’t come to help her. She stayed there till it was a bit before dusk when groups of people came and got her out…in pieces.” ~ Sabah Al Mushref.…UPDATE 16.7.2018: A recent CNN report on the predicament of the White Helmets claims that diplomatic sources have told them that the U.K, Germany and Canada will be the countries to receive refugee White Helmets. This is worrying blowback as these terrorist affiliates will be absorbed into the societies whose governments created them and sustained them. Will they be redirected? Will they be utilised to further discredit and vilify the Syrian government, SAA and allies? Will they be expected to train new teams of interventionist instruments for future campaigns? Will our Fire Services be expected to employ them, despite cut backs and austerity measures imposed by this Tory government?Too many questions and too many consequences of the UK FCO financing of yet another regime change war that has failed and is now coming home to roost.***Vanessa Beeley is an independent journalist, peace activist, photographer and associate editor at 21st Century Wire.

In 2013 Boris Johnson’s brother Jo was appointed head of No 10’s policy unit under David Cameron. As the Guardian article noted, this appointment did not appear to be a crucial necessity: “it’s not as if anyone had complained of a dire shortage of Johnsons in the public eye, or of Old Etonians in the cabinet.”Bullingdon Club, Oxford 1987. Boris Johnson seated on right, Cameron second from left standing at back. (Photo: Telegraph)Cameron and Johnson are both “Old Etonians” and shared the notoriety of being members of the elite Bullingdon Club at Oxford, whose members were renonwned for ostentatious displays of wealth, raucous, hard-drinking dinners and the exclusion of women from their ranks.I am not going to dwell upon the vagaries of such clubs and networks that united the establishment elite into an exclusive consortium of wealth and privilege that has served them well throughout their careers and countless falls from grace.However, now the White Helmets are involved believe it or not in a way that fully exposes the nepotism and corruption at the highest levels of policy making and intervention into the affairs of a sovereign nation, in this case, Syria.Mayday RescueMayday Rescue is the allegedly Netherlands based NGO funded by a number of the governments that have a very transparent objective of regime change in Syria. Mayday Rescue was established by James Le Mesurier, a British ex-Sandhurst private security “expert”, who had previously set up the White Helmets in Turkey and Jordan while employed by the ARK Group DMCC.Both ARK Group and Mayday Rescue are funded by the UK FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) Conflict Stability and Security Fund that coincidentally was created in 2015 and allowed Mayday Rescue to take over the financing of the White Helmets, providing valuable plausible deniability for the government of “Global Britain” – the term coined by Theresa May and echoed by Boris Johnson. Prior to the creation of the CSSF, it appears that the ARK Group’s establishment of the White Helmets was funded by CSSF’s predecessor, the Syria Conflict Pool.The CEO of ARK, Alistair Harris, also works in collaboration with the UK’s National Security complex. He is also CEO of The Stabilisation Network DMCC, based in Dubai, which is listed as one of the CSSF approved contractors. Both Harris and Le Mesurier have been awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) – Harris for services in Lebanon. Le Mesurier was rewarded for “services to Syria Civil Defence and the protection of civilians in Syria“.Both men, therefore, have close ties to the UK National Security apparatus and an expertise in implementing security solutions, working in private sector military circles and imposing “stabilisation” projects upon UK FCO designated nations, including Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Afghanistan, Lebanon and in the case of Le Mesurier, Kosovo. Both men work out of Dubai. The initial register of Mayday Rescue was in Dubai before it was relocated to the more neutral Netherlands and Le Mesurier works for Bush’s ex-terror advisor, the Terror Czar himself, Richard A. Clark, at Good Harbour International in Dubai.The links between these players in the Global Britain subcontracter market are clearly defined.The Eton MessAndrew Gilmour with Ban Ki-Moon (UN Press)In October 2016 a young man left Oxford University and walked straight into a position as Operations manager at Mayday Rescue. His name is Archie Gilmour. He is the son of Andrew Gilmour – “United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today announced the appointment of Andrew Gilmour of the United Kingdom as Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Head of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in New York.”According to the UN Press release:“Since joining the United Nations in 1989, he has held a variety of positions at United Nations Headquarters and in the field, including in Afghanistan-Pakistan, Kosovo, State of Palestine and West Africa. In recent years, he has served as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq, and later, in South Sudan. Prior to his current position, he was the Representative of the Secretary-General in Belgrade.”Perhaps more importantly, Gilmour was at Eton College with Boris Johnson and then they were reunited at Balliol College, Oxford:“Johnson arrived at Eton as a scholar in the autumn of 1977, aged 13. He was part of the school’s intellectual elite, accommodated in a separate house and marked out by being made to wear gowns. By the time he left, at the end of 1982, he had become a commanding figure with a reputation as a star performer. His speciality was forgetting his lines. One of his friends, Andrew Gilmour, remembers Johnson reciting the first page of Evelyn Waugh’s Decline and Fall, which begins: “Mr Sniggs, the Junior Dean, and Mr Postlethwaite, the Domestic Bursar . . .” ~ Daily MailJohnson’s return to Balliol in May 2017 was not the victorious homecomeing to his alma mater that he may have wished for:Boris wanted a quiet visit to his old college for lunch today. Students found out and had other ideas. pic.twitter.com/2gCtglTyXW — Novara Media (@novaramedia) May 28, 2017Archie Gilmour of Mayday Rescue is also Boris Johnson’s Godson. The nepotism circle is closed.London Mayor Boris Johnson, who is also Archie’s Godfather (second from right) in 2011. (Photo: Portugal News Online)Why Should this Matter?It should matter very much. Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson is responsible for the continued presence of Global Britain’s troops in Syria on the extraordinary pretext of “defending Iraq from ISIS” – based upon Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon’s reply to Baroness Cox on 22nd February 2018:Johnson has publicly heaped praise upon the White Helmets despite the growing mountain of evidence that they are embedded with a number of terrorist (Al Qaeda) and extremist factions inside Syria and are responsible for producing the bulk of the propaganda that serves to criminalise the Syrian government and its allies. Johnson has increased funding to this sectarian group of British produced and trained pseudo-“humanitarians” and the UK FCO has recently admitted to financing the White Helmets almost £ 39m since their creation in 2013.…The Foreign Secretary of Global Britain, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Head of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in New York and an Operations Manager at the White Helmet-financing Mayday Rescue are intrinsically linked, when viewed through the elite network prism that has secured jobs for the boys for centuries. Old Etonians and Oxford graduates united behind an organisation destined to be an integral part of the Syria whose future does not include the elected President, Bashar Al Assad, according to these Global Britain acolytes.Where will complaints from the Syrian people against the White Helmets go within the UN? They will be swept into the memory hole that will secure Archie’s future in the Global Britain security and stabilisation industry. No dissent against the White Helmets will be tolerated by the Eton guild. Corruption at this level should not surprise us, nepotism should not come as a shock but the benefits reaped by the initiated come at the expense of innocent people whose blood is being shed while the champagne glasses clink over another appointment made by the privileged for the privileged.Archie Gilmour is very unlikely to question the hidden agenda of the White Helmets, he would prefer not to derail his own career path in favour of truth, not when his Godfather and father are a part of the apparatus that requires the image of the White Helmets to remain untarnished and credible, both in Syria and in future destabilization zones where Archie will deploy his rebranded stabilization teams to repair the damage brought about by Global Britain’s colonialist zeal.This is a simple story, a revealing one, and one that goes to the heart of the corrosion of our society in the West. Our institutions, including the UN, are owned and controlled by those who will exploit their founding principles for their own gains, not for the “humantarian” principles they claim to uphold. These plutocrats are violently inflicting a faux “democracy” upon nations who courageously defend their right to decide their own future according to the “international” laws put in place by those who now violate them at will because they know the establishment has their back.On the other hand:What elitist education gets you.A #BritishEmpire gimp with a self-cultivated blind spot the size of the sun on his own country's connivance with, and sponsorship of, terrorists. pic.twitter.com/OjMiqaajdO — Syricide (@Syricide) July 4, 2018***Vanessa Beeley is an independent journalist, peace activist, photographer and associate editor at 21st Century Wire.

They were furious with us for our march and for raising the Syrian flag, because it ruined their plans” ~ Ibrahim Omar Toumeh, resident of Hamouriya, 45 years old.Some weeks after the liberation of Eastern Ghouta which had been occupied by a series of militant and extremist groups backed and armed by a variety of NATO-member-states, Gulf States and protected by Israel, I had the opportunity to interview civilians from all districts, both on the ground in Ghouta and in the nearby IDP (Internally Displaced People) camps that consisted of highly organised education centres for children, clean single-floor buildings that housed extended families, and that provided clean water, electricity, food and essential supplies to the thousands of temporary residents.Ibrahim Omar Toumeh talks to Vanessa Beeley, April 2018. (Photo: Vanessa Beeley)I met Ibrahim Omar Toumeh in Harjalleh camp. He had arrived from Hamouriya one week previously, with his entire family. He and his family were keen to talk about their experiences living under Failaq Al Rahman rule (Al Qaeda affiliate) in their neighborhood. The usual stories of deprivation, imprisonment, sectarian brutality were recounted. I was told that the White Helmets worked as “one hand” with the terrorist factions throughout Eastern Ghouta:“White Helmets worked everywhere, they had points in all places – Harasta, Douma, Misrata, Otaya and they had centres in other sectors also alongside Failaq Al Rahman brigade (Nusra Front affiliate). They had points in Jobar also. Everywhere in Ghouta. They worked with terrorist groups like Jaish Al Islam, Failaq Al Rahman, Fair Al-Ummah (Dawn of the Nations).”~ Mahmoud Al Khaled, resident of Hamouriya.Toumeh described what he believed happened in Hamouriya on the 6th March 2018 and the days leading up to that date. He told me that at this time, the Syrian Arab Army were rapidly advancing towards Hamouriya and civilians were beginning to feel empowered and more able to protest the presence of Failaq Al Rahman and their associates, the White Helmets and other militant groups.Pro-government civilians in Hamouriyah/#EastGhouta raise the Syrian flag in the town 🇸🇾 pic.twitter.com/oZTVMJXgzK — Kevork Almassian (@KevorkAlmassian) March 6, 2018“On the 6th of March a major conference was due to be held in the UN. We always knew about these conferences because of the co-ordinators in Hamouriya that worked with people inside the UN. On the 4th and 5th of March, the White Helmets and the armed groups began to gather bodies in the hospital. They brought these bodies from everywhere, and they brought them to the place where they would stage an attack. By the 5th, they had around 30 bodies in the hospital and the White Helmets started to take photographs.”~ Ibrahim ToumehWatch this video of Hamouriya residents raising the Syrian flag on 6th March 2018:…Toumeh continued:“On the 6th March, we knew the Syrian Arab Army was getting closer. A group of us decided to march in the streets of Hamouriya and to raise the Syrian flag in solidarity with the Army. We knew the armed groups (Failaq Al Rahman) were betting on a western military intervention with reinforcements from the U.S base at Al Tanf. The armed groups told us that there were even ISIS terrorists from Deir Ezzor among these groups in Al Tanf.”[EDIT: Investigative journalist, Elijah Magnier, had written about the US secret plans to divert militants from Al Tanf camp to reinforce the extremist groups in control of Eastern Ghouta, in his article: The US Secret Plan on Damascus Foiled – The Russian Role Before the US/UK/France Attack Revealed]When I checked the 6th March in the UN calendar there had, indeed, been a high level discussion on Syria. “The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, attended a meeting today with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Turkey, hosted by the Russian Federation at its permanent mission in Geneva.”Toumeh then told me:“The armed groups were always telling us that the West would intervene and help them to conquer Damascus. After six years of their lies, we knew it was not going to happen. We were human shields for them, nothing more. We were fed up with their lies, so we raised the Syrian flag and we marched to tell them (Failaq Al Rahman) to leave Hamouriya.About an hour after we raised the flag, one of the head co-ordinators came to us with another person and he told us that we had ruined their plans. I asked why. They told me they had released “news” of a chemical attack the night before, saying 30 people had been killed. When we raised the flag around 3pm or 3.30pm the day after, we ruined it for them”Ibrahim Omar Toumeh (on right), a resident of Hamouriya, Eastern Ghouta. (Photo: Vanessa Beeley)I asked Toumeh why he thought they said it was ruined, he smiled and then replied:“They told me – ‘how can an area get hit by chemical weapons by the Syrian government and then hours later residents in the same area, are raising the Syrian flag?’. They also told me we had ruined their communications with the UN and that there would be no intervention from Al Tanf after all. The main co-ordinator’s name was Abdulmueeh Hommus.They wanted to present the “chemical attack” on the day the SAA entered Hamouriya, you see? The next day Failaq Al Rahman issued a Fatwa against all of us. All of us were sentenced to death. They brought one of their prisoners, they wrapped him in the Syrian flag and they shot him dead with three bullets to threaten us. We didnt care. We co-ordinated with the Army and they helped us to leave Hamouriya.”The following video shows some of the Failaq Al Rahman reprisals against the civilian protestors in Hamouriya. WATCH:…Many reports on the SAA military campaign centering on Hamouriya confirm that the final liberation of this town was imminent. According to SouthFront’s war report on March 7th:On March 6, the White Helments, a notorious organization operating in areas controlled by al-Qaeda-linked militants, reported that government forces had conducted a new chlorine gas attack in Eastern Ghouta allegedly injuring 30 people. It’s interesting to note that reports about alleged chemical attacks started appearing during a rapid advance by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and its allies against Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda), Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman.By March 7, SAA troops had liberated a large area, including farms near the towns of Misraba and Beit Sawa. The town of Hammouriyah had reportedly surrendered to the SAA and government troops had started entering it.” (Emphasis added)The White Helmet twitter feed confirms their claim of a chlorine gas attack in Hamouriya on the 6th March:Following a Regime #chlorine gas attack in #Hamorieh city, more than 30 suffocation cases including women, children, #CivilDefense volunteers, only hours after the Aid convoy arrived and left #EasternGhouta . This is attack number 8 in 2018 pic.twitter.com/IlbByRMP2d — The White Helmets (@SyriaCivilDef) March 5, 2018Toumeh is not the only one to have spoken to me about this staged chemical attack.32 year old Mohammed Al Khatib is also from Hamouriya. I interviewed him in April 2018. He told me:“The chemical attack was going to be staged to the East of the town in the direction of the Syrian Arab Army. The day before, the White Helmets started to bring bodies to the area, to the hospital. The media groups working with the armed groups also came. They started to film and photograph the bodies. There were many children among the dead. At this time all the medical centres were out of service. Only the White Helmets were bringing bodies from all over Hamouriya to this one centre so it would look as if they had been killed in this attack. On the 6th March after we had marched and raised the flag, we were approached by some of the White Helmet members. They were very angry with us. They told us they wanted to force the West to intervene on their behalf but now their plan would not work and it was our fault. This was the first time we saw them actually preparing a movie against our country. Usually they would make us go into the basement until they had finished filming an event.”Mohammed a father and grandfather from Hamouriya was among those severely punished by Failaq Al Rahman for raising the Syrian flag on the 6th March 2018. I have already told his harrowing story in a previous article:SEE ALSO: Voices From Eastern Ghouta, Video Testimonies.The Main PlayersWhen I first heard these testimonies which were echoed by a number of other witnesses from Hamouriya but not in so much detail, I began to piece together the events of the 6th March 2018 and found that much of what had been described to me fell into place alongside tweets and reports from the various Western backed organisations on the ground in Eastern Ghouta.Those organisations were headed up by the U.S Coalition multi-million-dollar financed White Helmets, with a history of being the preferred source for evidence of previous alleged chemical weapon attacks, including Khan Sheikhoun one year ago in April 2017.The reliance on the White Helmets to provide the narratives to corroborate UK and U.S government policy in Syria has been undeniably demonstrated by a UK FCO document outlining funding for the White Helmets via the Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF).SEE ALSO: White Helmets: ‘Humanitarians’ and the ‘Moderate’ Bomb Factory in Saqba, Eastern Ghouta.Toumeh had told me the demonstrations and flag raising took place around 3pm in the afternoon. The first announcements of an SAA chlorine attack in Hamouriya began to appear from late on the night of the 5th of March (depending on time zone) and then during the day of the 6th March as seen in the White Helmet tweet I have included in the article.The media and advocacy manager for the White Helmets, Asaad Hanna, was among the first to signal the alleged chlorine attack in Hamouriya. It is worth bearing in mind that according to his own CV, Hanna also is a contributor at Chatham House the British Government-linked policy institute, The Washington Times and TRT World, Turkish state media.Hanna is a researcher at the Washington-based Toran Centre, where Professor Scott Lucas of EA Worldview is also a consultant. Dima Moussa is also a researcher at the Toran centre – and Moussa is the newly elected Vice-President of the Syrian National Coalition Of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces (formerly known as the SNC, the US-created ‘opposition government’ in exile) and had previously worked for ARK Group and Mayday Rescue, according to her LinkedIn page.The founder of the White Helmets, James Le Mesurier worked for ARK Group when he established the White Helmets in Turkey, Moussa was with ARK during this period. Le Mesurier then went on to set up Mayday Rescue, ostensibly in the Netherlands (Wayback machine shows the Mayday address in Dubai) as an intermediary to receive and transfer funds from the UK FCO CSSF to the White Helmets. During her time as Operations Manager at Mayday Rescue, Moussa was clearly involved in the day to day support for the White Helmets.I will go into greater depth about these connections in a subsequent article but this information demonstrates how closely knit these organisations are and how they form a network that is capable of promulgating Syrian narratives favourable to the US Coalition interventionist road map – rapidly and across a diverse and extensive information base that includes corporate media, think tanks and government-aligned institutions, thus ensuring their influence over policy decisions by governments such as the UK and U.S, already heavily invested in the “regime change” operation in Syria.New CHEMICAL ATTACK on Hammouria neighborhood in #EasternGhouta, dozens of people suffocating just few hours after the @UN withdrew from #Ghouta before delivering the convoy.Obviously they went out after they new the Russians and Assad will ize the chemical weapons again. — Asaad Hanna (@AsaadHannaa) March 5, 2018The Ayman Asfari -funded “Violations Documentation Centre” (VDC) put out a ‘witness’ statement on Twitter on the 6th March:Ayman Asfari also provided seed funding and ongoing support for Syria Campaign who effectively run the publicity campaign for the White Helmets and has succeeded in presenting these Al Qaeda (and associated extremist groups) affiliates as “impartial, unarmed and neutral humanitarians” for five years since their creation in March 2013, in Turkey.VDC had previously used one of the more notorious White Helmets as an “expert” witness for another alleged chemical weapon attack in Sarmin, Idlib in March 2015. Muawiya Agha Hassan is perhaps best known for his criminal participation in the torture and execution of two SAA prisoners of war in Khan Touman, Aleppo in April 2016.Muawiya Agha HassanOne of the exclusive witnesses for chemical weapons usage by the Syrian government. (UN/HRW) https://t.co/qKyVkjB8DL pic.twitter.com/FMtHvatq08 — Friedemann Wo (@FriedemannWo) February 13, 2017In the early hours of the morning of the 7th March Dr Zaher Sahloul of SAMS (Syrian American Medical Society) tweeted the statement from the so-called Syrian Interim Government retracting claims of a “chlorine attack” which ties in with the statements from Toumeh and Khatib – that their march and protests had derailed plans by the White Helmets and Failaq Al Rahman – to stage a chlorine attack event:It looks that the reported “#Chlorine” attack in Ghouta yesterday was due to exposure to irritating fumes from high potency explosives after all pic.twitter.com/h0NeFPZhrq — Dr. Zaher Sahloul (@sahloul) March 6, 2018The VDC tweet had been picked up by Syrian “armed opposition” and White Helmet supporter, Professor Scott Lucas of EA Worldview (consultant at the Toran Centre) in an article published the same day, the 6th March. The information was only updated in a separate report on the 7th March when Lucas confirmed that a chemical attack had not actually taken place in Hamouriya on the 6th March:“As the residents of Hamouriya surrendered, the opposition’s Health Directorate said a Monday “gas attack” was actually fumes from high-potency explosives.”When I challenged Lucas on why he had not corrected the first article rather than burying the retraction in a ‘follow-up’ article, he responded with familiar defensive avoidance tactics:Now your turn: please address questions you avoided on Wed. 1. Name #Assad regime officials who enabled your ""journalism"" in #Syria 2. Provide any evidence for yr falsehood ""kidnapped children by #WhiteHelmets"" in #EastGhouta#Syria #FunWithAssadTrolls — Scott Lucas (@ScottLucas_EA) June 28, 2018Joyce Karam of The National was another one to run with the story literally as it appeared on the Twitter pages of the moderate extremist support groups and individuals, such as Mohamad Katoub, advocacy manager for SAMS – based in… Gaziantep, Turkey:6 children, 4 women, and 2 men were reported to be contaminated by a #chlorine attack in Hamorieh in #Ghouta tonight. All victims arrived with moderate symptoms, and no fatality was reported. This is attack number 8 in 2018 and 198 since 2012 — Mohamad Katoub (@MhdKatoub) March 5, 2018The National alludes to the threat of U.S. intervention if ‘another chemical attack’ is perceived to have been carried out by the SAA:If the attack is proven, it comes at a tricky time for the debate in Washington. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that “the Trump administration has considered new military action against the Syrian government in response to reports of ongoing chemical weapons use.” (Emphasis added)Al Araby UK also ran the story based upon the White Helmet accounts and has not retracted it to my knowledge, the article is still available on their website and has not been updated.France Threatens InterventionBearing in mind Toumeh’s claims that these “chlorine attacks” were staged in an attempt by Failaq Al Rahman and the White Helmets to pressure the West to intervene on their behalf, it was not surprising to see that France was posturing wildly as Eastern Ghouta was being liberated and the Western proxy grip on Damascus was finally being prised apart.On the 8th March:“If the use of chemical weapons were found, verified, attributed and the use of the chemical weapon left people dead,” France would take “intervention measures to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons,”– Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Foreign Minister.On the 12th March:“The day we have, in particular in tandem with our American partners, irrefutable proof that the red line was crossed — namely the chemical weapons were used to lethal effect — we will do what the Americans themselves did moreover a few months ago; we would put ourselves in position to proceed with targeted strikes,”– French President, Francois Macron.The race was on to fulfill this prophecy. Nothing could have given greater encouragement for the US Coalition assets on the ground in Syria to produce a chemical attack provocation than such bellicose rhetoric from Macron and Trump.Immediately after the retraction of the 6th March chlorine attack, another chlorine attack was allegedly carried out in Hamouriya on the 7th March which was picked up by The Guardian – Kareem Shaheen in Istanbul, to be precise – based upon testimony from the “rescue workers” which we must presume to be the White Helmets although they are not named by Shaheen.“They said 29 people, including 15 children, were admitted to a medical centre with breathing problems after a suspected toxic gas attack on the towns of Hamoryah and Saqba.” (Emphasis added)A familiar White Helmet figure provided a dramatic statement for Al Jazeera.“Yesterday night was the darkest and most horrific night ever. They used phosphorus, napalm, cluster bombs and chlorine gas,” Ammar al-Selmo, a volunteer aid worker for the Syrian Civil Defence, told Al Jazeera by phone from the opposition-held enclave.”In September 2016, Al-Selmo provided ‘evidence’ of the alleged Russian bombing of a humanitarian convoy west of Aleppo City. Investigative journalist, Gareth Porter, masterfully deconstructed this evidence in a later report.The following video was produced by @Syricide on Twitter based upon Al Selmo’s statements in September 2016. There is a remarkable similarity in sensationalism between the 2016 and 2017 statements. WATCH:…ConclusionsMedia outlets in the West have no issue with a rush to judgement regarding “suspected” chemical attacks when the source is a part of the approved team on the ground in Syria, dominated by the White Helmets. The stream of chemical weapon reports are repeated in a manner that barely raises any doubt over their credibility. Questions are not asked, and even when the narrative is then retracted, an attack one day later is reported without the caveat that victim symptoms may be the result of smoke inhalation, rather than chlorine or other toxic gas.The treadmill of “chemical attacks” must be maintained because that is what will instigate U.S coalition intervention, according to the U.S Coalition. Journalists should be mapping the correlation between SAA military advances, the uptick in U.S allied belligerence towards Syria and the increase in claims of chemical attacks by the extremist groups benefiting from U.S intervention. Of course this is not what happens. The western media journalists literally copy-paste the White Helmets supplied narrative that enables an escalation in military aggression in support of the sectarian, extremist occupiers of civilian areas in Syria.To what degree does the tail wag the dog? Are the U.K, U.S. and France genuinely in control of the White Helmet narratives, do they communicate with co-ordinators on the ground when they feel it is most convenient to receive news of a chemical attack? Or, do the White Helmets take control at times when they feel threatened, in order to trigger international reactions?The importance given to the protection of the White Helmets by UN agencies, was condemned by Dr Bashar Al Jaafari, Syrian permanent representative to the UN, on the 16th March.“He warned that giving the opportunity for terrorist groups, including the so-called “White Helmets” which are affiliated to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, to use the Security Council as a podium constitutes a flagrant violation of UNSC resolutions, particularly those related to combating terrorism, adding “the biggest scandal is that a UN agency operating in Damascus demanded the evacuation of 76 members of White Helmets from Eastern Ghouta, while paying no attention to the lives of thousands of civilians.”HRW (Human Rights Watch) who, by their own admission, rely heavily upon the White Helmets for their evidence in Syria, reported on March 17th that they had received a distress call from the White Helmets claiming a number of them were surrounded by the SAA and were fearing “summary execution”.White Helmets had issued similar reports during the final hours of the liberation of East Aleppo. Owen Jones of The Guardian repeated those stories without hesitation at the time. I was on the ground in Aleppo during liberation and again in Eastern Ghouta. Any White Helmets or armed factions who took Amnesty, were evacuated safely with their families to Idlib.The April 7th Douma alleged chemical attack was also dismissed as a non-chemical bombing by medical staff who treated victims in the Douma Medical Point. This was reported by Robert Fisk and by a number of other journalists, independent and mainstream who visited the site, including myself.Despite the clear possibility of this being another misreported “chemical attack”, the corporate media seemed to suffer from selective amnesia in their usual rush to judgement that provided cover for the U.S, U.K and France to unlawfully bomb Syria on the 14th April. This amnesia also covers the existence of chemical weapon manufacturing facilities under the control of the extremist groups across Eastern Ghouta, including Jaish Al Islam in Douma.‼️April 6, 2018 #Syria-n Army found a #CW Lab in #GhoutaUnreported by the Primary supporters of the regime change “humanitarian”war narrative, #CNN correspondent, Frederick Pleitgen, his camerawoman and a translator were on this trip with @VanessaBeeley https://t.co/jbDavUXr5c — Sonia Mota (@SoniaKatiMota) April 11, 2018My interview with one of the medical staff who was present on the night of the alleged chemical attack on 7th April, in Douma. WATCH:…When we take into consideration the uniformity of narrative across the inter-connecting groups and support groups, including western media, it is hard not to conclude that truth is indeed the first casualty of war, brought to it’s knees by a narrative building apparatus that is ultimately financed and constructed by the hostile government agencies that benefit most from a contrived account of events on the ground in Syria.The #UK Decision at the @OPCW Conference of State Parties has passed with votes 82 in favour (24 No).

With tech giants now a willing dongle to government, the infrastructure is in place to decide what is ‘foreign interference’ and who will be taken down next. Now, a legal framework to scale it out to the masses is being planned.As seen earlier today in The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and the United States, also known as the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence partners, want more access and authority to target Internet users that “sow discord, manipulate public discourse, bias the development of policy, or disrupt markets.” The article continues:“Foreign interference threatens a nation’s sovereignty, values and national interests — it can limit or shape the polity’s ability to make independent judgements, erode public confidence in our political and government institutions, and interfere with private-sector decision making,” a joint communiqué read. “While senior digital industry representatives did not accept our invitation to participate in discussions on pressing issues regarding the illicit use of online spaces, we reiterated the need for digital industry to take more responsibility for content promulgated and communicated through their platforms and applications.” The communiqué also asserted an “urgent need for law enforcement to gain targeted access to data” subject to legal safeguards and for providers to voluntarily assist with investigations.During the Gold Coast meeting, the group also referenced ‘hostile nations’ in the context of online platforms – a term that gets tossed around endlessly but nobody really knows what it’s supposed to represent. To this day, there has been no hard evidence presented to the public, for example, proving the Russian government colluded or interfered in the 2016 US Presidential Election.We’ve even witnessed 21WIRE and many of our colleagues in alternative and independent media labeled ridiculously as ‘agents of the Kremlin’ for simply reporting the truth and informing the public of the news and information not being covering in the mainstream corporate-owned media.Given that many of us are citizens of the ‘Five Eyes’ countries, are we to be considered foreign hostile actors interfering with domestic politics?It’s time to reclaim the conversation and expose this for what it is: digital tyranny.READ MORE CENSORSHIP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Censorship FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1-NSA-Internet-Orwell.jpg5bcd4e9d351a4874bf87658fc7484033	['Featured News']	2018-08-18 00:00:00	Disgracebook: ‘Work With Us or Die’	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	Disgracebook: ‘Work With Us or Die’	0	"ByAccording to witnesses who were present at the meeting – a private conversation with Australian news publishers and broadcasters, Facebook’s head of news partnerships told the group that if they do not work with Facebook that their businesses would die.The comment is totally at odds with the effect that Facebook claims to have on journalism. At the meeting, the Facebook executive in question had been speaking about “revitalizing journalism”, and later stated that “our goal at Facebook — what the team works on every day with publishers and reporters around the world — is to help journalism succeed and thrive, both on our platform and off.”A senior Facebook executive has privately admitted Mark Zuckerberg “doesn’t care” about publishers and warned that if they did not work with the social media giant, 'I’ll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a ­hospice' https://t.co/DBVW7aFPhb — The Australian (@australian) August 12, 2018Although Facebook has demonstrated a pattern of removing or blocking content from its website, the news last week that Alex Jones’ InfoWars media outlet had been removed from a number of social media platforms (including Facebook) has caused renewed interest in the topic of internet censorship. It has also highlighted the market dominance of Facebook, Google and YouTube, which collectively with the mainstream media, now control a dangerous proportion of the information consumers are accessing.It is noteworthy that Australia’s competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is currently investigating whether Facebook and Google “have disrupted the news media market to the detriment of publishers and consumers.”The news that Facebook is telling news publishers that they will die should they decide not to work with the platform is not only shocking — it reeks of being a bona fide threat. The only thing missing from these reports is a line from The Godfather; after all, this sounds like an offer these publishers can’t refuse, or they might find themselves sleeping with the fishes.It is even more shocking when we consider the source. There is no small degree of irony in the fact that the Facebook executive who made the comments, Campbell Brown, had previously been a TV news reporter and anchor. Ms Brown, who built her career at NBC News before moving to CNN, won an Emmy for her coverage of Hurricane Katrina and anchored shows on both networks. As a former successful and high-profile journalist, she might be expected to understand the concept and the value of a free press. Would that be too much to ask?Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg with Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India (Photo: Prime Minister’s Office, Government of India.

However, Facebook is refusing to release its transcript and tape of the gathering.Facebook is saying these comments didn't happen but The Australian has an explosive story on the company's position with publishers.

(Photo: Michael Zimmermann/21WIRE. Source: Wikicommons)21WIRE says…The recent “deplatforming” of Alex Jones and InfoWars from a number of social media sites is just the tip of a much larger iceberg. It is not hard to see that we are entering a future in which the removal of social media and other internet content will be influenced and carried out, not only by big tech firms such as YouTube and Facebook, but by politicians, foreign and domestic governments and social media users, as well as other private interests.Although the simultaneous removal of Alex Jones from multiple platforms has grabbed headlines in both the mainstream press and independent media, in truth these moves have been underway for some time. As pointed out in the article below, the current movement to censor the internet can be partly traced back to events in Congress last November, when the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings targeting “Extremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online.”In this sense, it is not only the social media companies themselves which are participating in this censorship; the hand of the state is also present to instigate it, pressuring the platforms to do it so that politicians are at least somewhat insulated from accusations of censorship.There is also an international dimension to these moves, as various attempts to control internet content have taken place in countries as diverse as China, Israel and the Great Britain. In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May has been pressuring Silicon Valley to control content since even before the London Bridge attack in June 2017 when she declared war on online extremism.SEE ALSO: Reported first by The Australian under a headline which read “Work With Facebook or Die: Zuckerberg,” the social media giant has insisted the comments were taken out of context, even as five individuals who attended the four-hour meeting corroborated what Brown had stated. (Source: Mint Press)Even here at 21WIRE we are not immune from this type of pressure and control. As we reported last year, changes to Google’s search algorithms caused a substantial and ongoing decrease in traffic coming to this website, and hundreds of others like it. Many sites in the independent/alternative media are suffering a similar fate — on both the left and the right. This is well documented now. The common factor among them seems to be their dissent from establishment narratives.The Rolling Stone article reposted below does a good job of drawing attention to a number of these issues. However, as The Intercept‘s Glenn Greenwald highlights in the following tweets responding to the piece, the future may be grim. Not only will we see rival camps competing to censor their rivals’ content, but we are now on a course toward Chinese-style control and censorship, which unabashedly and directly silences political opposition.The last thing Greenwald highlights from the Rolling Stone piece is that Americans “have lost the ability to distinguish between general principles and political outcomes.” In other words, freedom of speech is in grave danger, if it isn’t already gone. As is often stated, popular speech needs no protection. Therefore if we as a society do not protect unpopular speech, then we do not have free speech at all.More on this from Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi…(Image: Piotr VaGla Waglowski, http://www.vagla.pl. Source: Wikicommons)Matt TaibbiRolling StoneSilicon Valley is changing its mind about censorship.Two weeks ago, we learned about a new campaign against “inauthentic” content, conducted by Facebook in consultation with Congress and the secretive think tank Atlantic Council — whose board includes an array of ex-CIA and Homeland Security officials — in the name of cracking down on alleged Russian disinformation efforts.­ As part of the bizarre alliance of Internet news distributors and quasi-government censors, the social network zapped 32 accounts and pages, including an ad for a real “No Unite the Right 2” anti-racist counter-rally in D.C. this past weekend.“This is a real protest in Washington, D.C. It is not George Soros. It is not Russia. It is just us,” said the event’s organizers, a coalition of easily located Americans, in a statement.Last week, we saw another flurry of censorship news. Facebook apparently suspended VenezuelaAnalysis.com, a site critical of U.S. policy toward Venezuela. (It was reinstated Thursday.) Twitter suspended a pair of libertarians, including @DanielLMcAdams of the Ron Paul Institute and @ScottHortonShow of Antiwar.com, for using the word “bitch” (directed toward a man) in a silly political argument. They, too, were later re-instated.More significantly: Google’s former head of free expression issues in Asia, Lokman Tsui, blasted the tech giant’s plan to develop a search engine that would help the Chinese government censor content.First reported by The Intercept, the plan was called “a stupid, stupid move” by Tsui, who added: “I can’t see a way to operate Google search in China without violating widely held international human rights standards.” This came on the heels of news that the Israeli Knesset passed a second reading of a “Facebook bill,” authorizing courts to delete content on security grounds.Few Americans heard these stories, because the big “censorship” news last week surrounded the widely hated Alex Jones. After surviving halting actions by Facebook and YouTube the week before, the screeching InfoWars lunatic was hit decisively, removed from Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify.Jones is the media equivalent of a trench-coated stalker who jumps out from behind a mailbox and starts whacking it in an intersection. His “speech” is on that level: less an idea than a gross physical provocation. InfoWars defines everything reporters are taught not to do.Were I Alex Jones, I would think Alex Jones was a false-flag operation, cooked up to discredit the idea of a free press.Moreover, Jones probably does violate all of those platforms’ Terms of Service. I personally don’t believe his Sandy Hook rants — in which he accused grieving parents of being actors in an anti-gun conspiracy — are protected speech, at least not according to current libel and defamation law. Even some conservative speech activists seem to agree.And yet: I didn’t celebrate when Jones was banned. Collectively, all these stories represent a revolutionary moment in media. Jones is an incidental player in a much larger narrative.Both the Jones situation and the Facebook-Atlantic Council deletions seem an effort to fulfill a request made last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Last October, Facebook, Google and Twitter were asked by Hawaii Senator Mazie Hizono to draw up a “mission statement” to “prevent the foment of discord.”Companies like Facebook might have balked before. They have long taken a position that’s very Star Trek, very Prime-Directive: We do not interfere. Mark Zuckerberg, as late as 2016, was saying, “editing content… that’s not us.”Part of this reluctance was probably ideological, but the main thing was the sheer logistical quandary of monitoring published content on the scale of a firm like Facebook. The company now has 2.23 billion users, and experts estimate that’s more than a billion new entries to monitor daily.Although it might have seemed minor, undertaking what Facebook did prior to 2016 — keeping porn and beheading videos out of your news feed — was an extraordinarily involved technical process.This was underscored by fiascoes like the “Napalm Girl” incident in 2016, when the firm deleted a picture of Kim Phúc, the nine-year-old Vietnamese girl photographed running from napalm in 1972. The iconic picture helped reverse global opinion about the Vietnam War.Facebook ultimately put the photo back up after being ripped for “abusing its power.” This was absurd: The photo had been flagged by mostly automated processes, designed to keep naked pictures of pre-teens off the site.As a former Facebook exec tells Rolling Stone: “Knowing that ‘Napalm Girl’ is one of the icons of international journalism isn’t part of the fucking algo.”It would seem like madness to ask companies to expand that vast automated process to make far more difficult intellectual distinctions about journalistic quality. But that has happened.After Trump’s shocking win in 2016, everyone turned to Facebook and Google to fix “fake news.” But nobody had a coherent definition of what constitutes it.Many on the left lamented the Wikileaks releases of Democratic Party emails, but those documents were real news, and the complaint there was more about the motives of sources, and editorial emphasis, rather than accuracy…Continue reading this article at Rolling StoneREAD MORE CENSORSHIP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Censorship FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV"	https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AJ-censored1.jpgaf6481f8d06f42c19f1102441b8d9e3e	[]	2018-08-02 00:00:00	VIDEO: Facebook, Twitter, Google Intentionally Suppress Conservative Content	https://21stcenturywire.com/	US	VIDEO: Facebook, Twitter, Google Intentionally Suppress Conservative Content	0	"ByWith all the public furor about Cambridge Analytica the corporate media and political establishment has extremely careful to avoid mentioning the role of the George Soros-funded radical left-wing political organization Media Matters in data mining and advising social media monopolists on how to restrict content on their platforms under the cover of “fighting fake news”.As it turns out, there is a clear, politically bias agenda which governs Facebook and others censorship algorithms.

The information is so sensitive that details have not been shared with allies and have been restricted within the U.S. government. It is described as “code-word” information, referring to the highest classification level that American information (spy) agencies use.Immediately after the meeting, White House officials tried to minimize the damage by alerting the CIA and the National Security Agency. They hoped to prevent hostility from the source.At one point during the meeting, Trump seemed to be bragging, saying, “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day.” He then described details about how ISIS plans to use laptop computers as bombs on planes, and although he did not share the specific intelligence gathering method, he did indicate the city within ISIS territory where the information was obtained. Additional information about the content of the President’s disclosure is not being published for reasons of national security.The incident gave officials several reasons for concern. First, Trump discussed parts of the plan that were known to the U.S only because of the efforts of a key U.S. intelligence partner; by sharing the information, Trump placed the provider of that information in danger since Russia may be able to figure out the source.A second concern is that exposure of this important source of information about the Islamic State could become an obstacle to the ability of the U.S. and U.S. allies to find out about future threats.

The information is so sensitive that details have not been shared with allies and have been restricted within the U.S. government. It is described as “code-word” information, referring to the highest classification level that American information (spy) agencies use.Immediately after the meeting, White House officials tried to minimize the damage by alerting the CIA and the National Security Agency. They hoped to prevent hostility from the source.At one point during the meeting, Trump seemed to be bragging, saying, “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day.” He then described details about how ISIS plans to use laptop computers as bombs on planes, and although he did not share the specific intelligence gathering method, he did indicate the city within ISIS territory where the information was obtained. Additional information about the content of the President’s disclosure is not being published for reasons of national security.The incident gave officials several reasons for concern. First, Trump discussed parts of the plan that were known to the U.S only because of the efforts of a key U.S. intelligence partner; by sharing the information, Trump placed the provider of that information in danger since Russia may be able to figure out the source.A second concern is that exposure of this important source of information about the Islamic State could become an obstacle to the ability of the U.S. and U.S. allies to find out about future threats. There is also concern that the President compromised national security by reducing the likelihood that U.S. allies will share intelligence with Washington.Another concern is that the incident may erode the trust essential for sharing information. Rules of espionage hold that governments and individual agencies decide how and to whom information they gather is distributed, even after it is shared.

Perhaps not surprisingly, many aspects of his life were written out of the story, including his ethnicity. The basics remained the same: a lawman hunting bad guys, accompanied by a Native American, riding on a white horse, and with a silver trademark.Historians of the American West have also, until recently, ignored the fact that this man was African American, a free black man who headed West to find himself less subject to the racist structure of the established Eastern and Southern states.While historians have largely overlooked Reeves, there have been a few notable works on him. Vaunda Michaux Nelson’s book, Bad News for Outlaws: The Remarkable Life of Bass Reeves, Deputy U.S. Marshal, won the 2010 Coretta Scott King Award for best author. Arthur Burton released an overview of the man’s life a few years ago. Black Gun, Silver Star: The Life and Legend of Frontier Marshal Bass Reeves recounts that Reeves was born into a life of slavery in 1838. His slave-keeper brought him along as another personal servant when he went off to fight with the Confederate Army, during the Civil War.Reeves took the chaos that ensued during the war to escape for freedom, after beating his “master” within an inch of his life, or according to some sources, to death. Perhaps the most intruiging thing about this escape was that Reeves only beat his enslaver after the latter lost sorely at a game of cards with Reeves and attacked him.After successfully defending himself from this attack, he knew that there was no way he would be allowed to live if he stuck around.Reeves fled to the then Indian Territory of today’s Oklahoma and lived harmoniously among the Seminole and Creek Nations of Native American Indians.After the Civil War finally concluded, he married and eventually fathered ten children, making his living as a Deputy U.S. Marshall in Arkansas and the Indian Territory. If this surprises you, it should, as Reeves was the first African American to ever hold such a position.Burton explains that it was at this point that the Lone Ranger story comes in to play. Reeves was described as a “master of disguises”. He used these disguises to track down wanted criminals, even adopting similar ways of dressing and mannerisms to meet and fit in with the fugitives, in order to identify them.Reeves kept and gave out silver coins as a personal trademark of sorts, just like the Lone Ranger’s silver bullets. Of course, the recent Disney adaptation of the Lone Ranger devised a clever and meaningful explanation for the silver bullets in the classic tales. For the new Lone Ranger, the purposes was to not wantonly expend ammunition and in so doing devalue human life. But in the original series, there was never an explanation given, as this was simply something originally adapted from Reeves’ personal life and trademarking of himself. For Reeves, it had a very different meaning, he would give out the valuable coins to ingratiate himself to the people wherever he found himself working, collecting bounties. In this way, a visit from the real “Lone Ranger” meant only good fortune for the town: a criminal off the street and perhaps a lucky silver coin.Like the Lone Ranger, Reeves was also expert crack shot with a gun. According to legend, shooting competitions had an informal ban on allowing him to enter. Like the Lone Ranger, Reeves rode a white horse throughout almost all of his career, at one point riding a light grey one as well.Like the famed Lone Ranger legend Reeves had his own close friend like Tonto. Reeves’ companion was a Native American posse man and tracker who he often rode with, when he was out capturing bad guys. In all, there were close to 3000 of such criminals they apprehended, making them a legendary duo in many regions.The final proof that this legend of Bass Reeves directly inspired into the story of the Lone Ranger can be found in the fact that a large number of those criminals were sent to federal prison in Detroit. The Lone Ranger radio show originated and was broadcast to the public in 1933 on WXYZ in Detroit where the legend of Reeves was famous only two years earlier.Of course, WXYZ and the later TV and movie adaptions weren’t about to make the Lone Ranger an African American who began his career by beating a slave-keeper to death. But now you know. Spread the word and let people know the real legend of the Lone Ranger.(Article by Micah Naziri)Related Posts via Taxonomies"	http://politicalblindspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wxyz.jpgafecfe17915a4ed482f41524e7efe036	['Pbspot Admin', 'Will Phoenix', 'Navy Corpseman']		The Food Stamp Capital of the U.S. is WHITE and REPUBLICAN : Political Blind Spot	http://politicalblindspot.com/	US	The Food Stamp Capital of the U.S. is WHITE and REPUBLICAN : Political Blind Spot	0	"In spite of the prevailing stereotypes and assumptions about who uses SNAP Food Stamp benefits the most in the United States, the highest usage is not in Compton, Queens, nor the South Side of Chicago.

Maybe another thing is clear too: most opinions about vaccination (for or against) are influenced more by editorials on the subject, than by data itself. Thus, here is one more editorial on the subject, albeit one that does not pass judgment on vaccinations, for or against. It is, instead, intended as a call to research, and a reminder of the scientific maxim: correlation is not causation. That goes for both sides of this debate.On the anti-vaccination side, there are many claims made that are often based on things that the data might imply, but is far from proving. This results in many ideas that are later discredited being circulated as fact.On the pro-vaccination side, every time there is a measles outbreak, it seems mainstream news outlets trip over themselves to implicate “the growing trend to opt out of vaccinations” as the cause (read: causation). Again, “correlation is not causation”. Here’s why…If the measles outbreaks in California, and particularly in and around Orange County, as well as New York City are because of non-vaccinators, then why aren’t we seeing outbreaks of everything not being vaccinated for? Why just measles and why all of a sudden, when the number of people opting out of vaccinations has actually steadily dropped in the last few years – after an initial wave of people not doing it?Non-vaccinators in NY are .1-1% of the population. In California we are talking 1.1-2%. Why aren’t we seeing increases in outbreaks in Vermont, Michigan and Oregon where the rate is over 6%? Correlation (or worse yet, public perception of correlation), is not causation: whether it’s vaccines and autism, or whether it’s a tiny number of people not vaccinating, and a few places having measles outbreaks.What does the data show on measles in the states where opting out of vaccination trends the highest? There was an instance in Oregon last year, and one this year with a 6% rate of opting out in the state. A child in Washington County, Oregon who developed measles on an overseas trip and exposed hundreds of people in the Portland area. Add to that one case in Oregon this year where a child contracted measles from a vaccinated adult.Shouldn’t the state be the worst off? And where are Vermont’s outbreaks at 6% non-vaccination?Measles has been trending down, but in the past year it has spiked in the U.S. in spite of the trend of non-vaccination dropping a bit. Measles outbreaks have been happening all over the world in the past year, even and especially where there is no significant increase of anti-vaccination trends (Turkey, Vietnam, Philippines and several countries in Europe). It’s up in California which likely is accounted for by the fact that there is so much travel in California from abroad. The 2013 case in Oregon? That was a traveller too, who had been in and out of international airports before contracting the disease. Same thing with New York City where outbreaks have been happening at a rate higher than the statistical norm.States with the highest non-vaccination rates have not seen an increase in measles outbreaks that are statistically significant. News websites like to run with headlines that will get people to share, and vent outrage. But that doesn’t make such articles a good source of scientific data.Remember, if you take nothing else away from this: correlation is not causation. Just because you heard on the news that there are a lot of people not vaccinating their children (an exaggerated statement, to be sure), does not mean that the rise in measles globally is due to families in Utah refusing vaccinations across the board. This is all the more so when the correlation does not even overlap the places where vaccine refusal is the highest.Do some research. Use the search field on the CDC website. Hit your local University library up and search scholarly journals and databases. The data on these issues is not hiding, but it will not deliver itself to your email inbox without a little work. When you do the research you’ll find that the facts are not quite as sensational as many headlines might have you believe. There has been a recent spike in measles. That much is clear. But it is happening all over the world and it is actually not happening in places where people are refusing vaccinations the most. Whatever your position is on vaccinations, get the facts and don’t spread assumptions made by lazy writers. Again, that goes for both sides of the vaccination issue.(Article by M.B.
