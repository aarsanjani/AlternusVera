1,"Why Did Attorney General Loretta Lynch Plead The Fifth? Barracuda Brigade 2016-10-28 Print The administration is blocking congressional probe into cash payments to Iran. Of course she needs to plead the 5th. She either can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t recall, refuses to answer, or just plain deflects the question. Straight up corruption at its finest! 100percentfedUp.com ; Talk about covering your ass! Loretta Lynch did just that when she plead the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to Iran‚Äö√Ñ¬∂Corrupt to the core! Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration‚Äö√Ñ√¥s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has ‚Äö√Ñ√∫pleaded the Fifth‚Äö√Ñ√π Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch‚Äö√Ñ√¥s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. The response from the attorney general‚Äö√Ñ√¥s office is ‚Äö√Ñ√∫unacceptable‚Äö√Ñ√π and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her]role in providing cash to the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,‚Äö√Ñ√π Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch.

Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: And the news is breaking while we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner‚Äö√Ñ√¥s well-known penchant for lying, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ and, as Wallace indicated on this morning‚Äö√Ñ√¥s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway.

4,"Email HEALTHCARE REFORM TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚Äö√Ñ√ÆObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up "

6,"BREAKING! NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case‚Äö√Ñ¬∂Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times‚Äö√Ñ¬∂Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince 
Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton‚Äö√Ñ√¥s email server last week. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince claimed. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,‚Äö√Ñ√π he said. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‚Äö√Ñ√≤We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re going to go public with this if you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t reopen the investigation and you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t do the right thing with timely indictments,‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince explained. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫I believe ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince said. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫There‚Äö√Ñ√¥s five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince declared. 
Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince elaborated. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äö√Ñ√¥s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫So NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t,‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince contended. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫There is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,‚Äö√Ñ√π he stated. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫So the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the level just below commissioner ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince said. 
He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫but they can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t convene a grand jury. They can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t file charges.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫The prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,‚Äö√Ñ√π he explained. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Now, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
Marlow agreed that Bharara‚Äö√Ñ√¥s ‚Äö√Ñ√∫sterling reputation‚Äö√Ñ√π as a determined prosecutor was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫bad news for the Clintons.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
Prince agreed, but said, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫If people are willing to bend or break the law and don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really care about the Constitution or due process ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ if you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ who knows what level of pressure‚Äö√Ñ√π could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? 
Listen to interview here: 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫The point being, fortunately, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,‚Äö√Ñ√π Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has ‚Äö√Ñ√∫exposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department‚Äö√Ñ√π against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,‚Äö√Ñ√π he warned. 
As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that ‚Äö√Ñ√∫de Blasio wants to stay away from this.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫The evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,‚Äö√Ñ√π he said.

Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word ‚Äö√Ñ√∫no‚Äö√Ñ√π in the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫yes‚Äö√Ñ√π line on the county‚Äö√Ñ√¥s transportation sales surtax question.

FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI‚Äö√Ñ√¥s original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. 
Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would, in the unrelated case, review additional emails related to Clinton‚Äö√Ñ√¥s time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,‚Äö√Ñ√π Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫During that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state.

To All Members of the University Community: 
As I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m sure many of you did, I watched the election coverage late into the night, and had the opportunity to visit with students and staff at a results-watching event sponsored by the Ginsberg Center at the Michigan Union. It will take quite some time to completely absorb the results from yesterday‚Äö√Ñ√¥s election, understand the full implications, and discern the long-term impact on our university and our nation . More immediately, in the aftermath of a close and highly contentious election we continue to embrace our most important responsibility as a university community. Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support ALL who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. There are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. Students are planning a vigil tonight on the Diag at 6 p.m. Our Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources available for faculty seeking help in cultivating classroom environments that are responsive to national issues. I also want to make everyone aware of some of the plans and events we have had in place for today and beyond. ¬¨‚àë Our Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy is holding a Post-Election Analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the Weill Hall‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Annenberg Auditorium. Speakers include former U.S. Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson and Marina Whitman. ¬¨‚àë Our History Department has organized a community discussion led by faculty and students to include historical perspectives at 6 p.m. tonight in 1014 Tisch Hall. ¬¨‚àë The Office of Student Life will provide resources and referrals for support on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the Michigan Union‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Willis Ward Lounge. It will be open today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. ¬¨‚àë Our Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs is offering an open space of support to help members of our community connect during open hours today. MESA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s office is in the Michigan Union, Room 2202. ¬¨‚àë Tomorrow, our Ginsberg Center and Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a Post-election Dialogue: Impact, Perspective-taking, and Moving Forward. This event is part of the Student Life Professional Development Conference at 1 ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ 2 p.m. in the Michigan League‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Henderson Room. I know that other schools, colleges and offices across our campus are planning events as well. I thank everyone who is helping us come together and ask anyone scheduling a post election event post it on the University of Michigan Events Calendar. I hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty and staff of a great public research university governed by the people. Elections are often times of great change, but the values we stand for at U-M have been shaped over the course of nearly 200 years. Our mission remains as essential for society as ever: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫‚Äö√Ñ¬∂to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future.‚Äö√Ñ√π I look forward to working together with all of you to advance the work we do in service of the public ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ and to ensure that the University of Michigan will always be a welcoming place for all members of society.

In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‚Äö√Ñ√≤never Trumpers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 
It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s easy to glance at Tuesday‚Äö√Ñ√¥s popular vote ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama‚Äö√Ñ√¥s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What‚Äö√Ñ√¥s more, she far surpassed Obama‚Äö√Ñ√¥s 2012 vote total in Florida, the country‚Äö√Ñ√¥s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country‚Äö√Ñ√¥s most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation‚Äö√Ñ√¥s most critical battleground states. Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t yet final because not all precincts have reported.

17,"Go to Article Donald Trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government. He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he‚Äö√Ñ√¥d like to, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫punch him in the face.‚Äö√Ñ√π Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,‚Äö√Ñ√πComedian‚Äö√Ñ√π? 
Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how ‚Äö√Ñ√∫depressed‚Äö√Ñ√π the tycoon‚Äö√Ñ√¥s win in the presidential election had made him. 
The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Comedian‚Äö√Ñ√π in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump‚Äö√Ñ√¥s victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫How am I doing? I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m very depressed,‚Äö√Ñ√π the famously laconic ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Raging Bull‚Äö√Ñ√π actor told reporters. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫We have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday‚Äö√Ñ√¥s election, he replied: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Yes, absolutely. Things aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t being done right.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. 
In Manhattan, they held signs reading ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Your Wall Can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t Stand in Our Way‚Äö√Ñ√π ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. 
De Niro hasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a punk,‚Äö√Ñ√π ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a pig‚Äö√Ñ√π and ‚Äö√Ñ√∫an idiot.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d like to punch him in the face,‚Äö√Ñ√π he said before the election. 
Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro‚Äö√Ñ√¥s grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫If, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,‚Äö√Ñ√π said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano. 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Comedian,‚Äö√Ñ√π De Niro‚Äö√Ñ√¥s passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this year‚Äö√Ñ√¥s program for the American Film Institute‚Äö√Ñ√¥s annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles. ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Yahoo

18,"John McNaughton is a special American painter because of his subject matter and the intensity in which he portrays our current government‚Äö√Ñ¬∂troubled and corrupt. The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism. 
Here‚Äö√Ñ√¥s how McNaughton describes the painting: 
Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫What have you done?‚Äö√Ñ√π Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisper‚Äö√Ñ√Æthe U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama. 
THE FORGOTTEN MAN‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 
McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump. Awesome, huh? 
November 9th McNaughton announced via facebook that he sold the original to Sean Hannity: 
‚Äö√Ñ√∫Sean Hannity just purchased my painting ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Forgotten Man‚Äö√Ñ√π to give to Donald Trump to hang in the White House‚Äö√Ñ√π 
THE WHITE HOUSE!"
